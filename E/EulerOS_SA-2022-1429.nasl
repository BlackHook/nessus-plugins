  script_set_attribute(attribute:"synopsis", value:
"The remote EulerOS host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by
the following vulnerabilities :

  - A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a local user through
    crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend upgrading kernel past the effected
    versions or rebuilding past ec6af094ea28f0f2dda1a6a33b14cd57e36a9755 (CVE-2021-22600)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. Grant mapping operations
    often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success
    or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the
    results, performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately,
    when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively
    implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from
    one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be
    possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are
    vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and
    drivers/xen/gntdev.c. (CVE-2021-26932)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as 'driver domains'.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - An Out-of-Bounds Read was discovered in arch/arm/mach-footbridge/personal-pci.c in the Linux kernel
    through 5.12.11 because of the lack of a check for a value that shouldn't be negative, e.g., access to
    element -2 of an array, aka CID-298a58e165e4. (CVE-2021-32078)

  - In gre_handle_offloads of ip_gre.c, there is a possible page fault due to an invalid memory access. This
    could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-150694665References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39633)

  - In various setup methods of the USB gadget subsystem, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an
    incorrect flag check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution
    privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android
    kernelAndroid ID: A-210292376References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39685)

  - An out of memory bounds write flaw (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in
    the way users use mirroring (replication of files with NFS). A user, having access to the NFS mount, could
    potentially use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system. (CVE-2021-4157)

  - An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and namespaces
    subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged process that are controlled by
    cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of
    control groups. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the
    system. (CVE-2021-4197)

  - A use-after-free read flaw was found in sock_getsockopt() in net/core/sock.c due to SO_PEERCRED and
    SO_PEERGROUPS race with listen() (and connect()) in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, an attacker with a
    user privileges may crash the system or leak internal kernel information. (CVE-2021-4203)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3, net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information
    leak because of certain use of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that IPv6-based
    attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source addresses. (CVE-2021-45485)

  - In the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.12.4, net/ipv4/route.c has an information leak
    because the hash table is very small. (CVE-2021-45486)

  - A flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP network
    protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this flaw, an attempt to use more
    buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to a denial of service (DOS). (CVE-2022-0322)

  - A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the
    way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or
    escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-0330)
