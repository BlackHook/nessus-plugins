"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernel's filesystem sub-
    component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2022-1184)

  - In mmc_blk_read_single of block.c, there is a possible way to read kernel heap memory due to uninitialized
    data. This could lead to local information disclosure if reading from an SD card that triggers errors,
    with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product:
    AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-216481035References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20008)

  - In verity_target of dm-verity-target.c, there is a possible way to modify read-only files due to a missing
    permission check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges
    needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid
    ID: A-234475629References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20572)

  - Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV
    device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways
    being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious
    backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the
    gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they
    assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the
    backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access
    to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.
    The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of
    a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038
    gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus,
    9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no
    longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted
    access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then
    re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to
    revoke access in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which
    can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042 (CVE-2022-23040, CVE-2022-23042)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16-rc6. uapi_finalize in
    drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_uapi.c lacks check of kmalloc_array(). (CVE-2022-3105)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16-rc6. netvsc_get_ethtool_stats in
    drivers/net/hyperv/netvsc_drv.c lacks check of the return value of kvmalloc_array() and will cause the
    null pointer dereference. (CVE-2022-3107)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.16-rc6. kfd_parse_subtype_iolink in
    drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_crat.c lacks check of the return value of kmemdup(). (CVE-2022-3108)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this
    vulnerability is the function ipv6_renew_options of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to
    memory leak. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
    The identifier VDB-211021 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3524)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue
    is the function del_timer of the file drivers/isdn/mISDN/l1oip_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The
    manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier
    of this vulnerability is VDB-211088. (CVE-2022-3565)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function
    tcp_getsockopt/tcp_setsockopt of the component TCP Handler. The manipulation leads to race condition. It
    is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211089 was assigned to this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3566)

  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects
    the function inet6_stream_ops/inet6_dgram_ops of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to
    race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211090 is the identifier
    assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3567)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb
    enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed)
    into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of
    service. (CVE-2022-3586)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function
    devlink_param_set/devlink_param_get of the file net/core/devlink.c of the component IPsec. The
    manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier
    VDB-211929 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3625)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects
    the function vsock_connect of the file net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It
    is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211930 is the identifier assigned to this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3629)

  - In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused
    by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. (CVE-2022-41218)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A missing lock when clearing
    sk_user_data can lead to a race condition and NULL pointer dereference. A local user could use this flaw
    to potentially crash the system causing a denial of service. (CVE-2022-4129)

  - drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-
    space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory. (CVE-2022-43750)

  - A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SYSCTL subsystem in how a user changes certain
    kernel parameters and variables. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their
    privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-4378)

  - A flaw incorrect access control in the Linux kernel USB core subsystem was found in the way user attaches
    usb device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2022-4662)

  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows
    an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control
    configuration that is set up with 'tc qdisc' and 'tc class' commands. This affects qdisc_graft in
    net/sched/sch_api.c. (CVE-2022-47929)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network
    subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash. (CVE-2023-0394)

  - In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the
    transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list
    -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2023-1095)

  - cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes
    indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23454)
