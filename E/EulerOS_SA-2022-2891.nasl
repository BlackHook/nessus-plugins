  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - Insufficient control flow management for the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters may allow an
    authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. (CVE-2021-33061)

  - When setting font with malicous data by ioctl cmd PIO_FONT,kernel will write memory out of bounds.
    (CVE-2021-33656)

  - In several functions of binder.c, there is a possible way to represent the wrong domain to SELinux due to
    a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges
    needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid
    ID: A-200688826References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39686)

  - A memory leak problem was found in the TCP source port generation algorithm in net/ipv4/tcp.c due to the
    small table perturb size. This flaw may allow an attacker to information leak and may cause a denial of
    service problem. (CVE-2022-1012)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in drivers/net/hamradio. This flaw allows a
    local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service (DOS) when the mkiss or sixpack device
    is detached and reclaim resources early. (CVE-2022-1195)

  - Linux Kernel could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a concurrency
    use-after-free flaw in the bad_flp_intr function. By executing a specially-crafted program, an attacker
    could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the
    system. (CVE-2022-1652)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux Kernel from 4.18 to 4.19, an improper update of sock reference in TCP
    pacing can lead to memory/netns leak, which can be used by remote clients. (CVE-2022-1678)

  - A race condition was found the Linux kernel in perf_event_open() which can be exploited by an unprivileged
    user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit primitives such as kernel address
    information leak, arbitrary execution, etc. (CVE-2022-1729)

  - A flaw in Linux Kernel found in nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev() in drivers/nfc/nfcmrvl/main.c can lead to use
    after free both read or write when non synchronized between cleanup routine and firmware download routine.
    (CVE-2022-1734)

  - With shadow paging enabled, the INVPCID instruction results in a call to kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva. If INVPCID
    is executed with CR0.PG=0, the invlpg callback is not set and the result is a NULL pointer dereference.
    (CVE-2022-1789)

  - There is a sleep-in-atomic bug in /net/nfc/netlink.c that allows an attacker to crash the Linux kernel by
    simulating a nfc device from user-space. (CVE-2022-1975)

  - In various functions of the USB gadget subsystem, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing
    bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges
    needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid
    ID: A-213172319References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20009)

  - In lg_probe and related functions of hid-lg.c and other USB HID files, there is a possible out of bounds
    read due to improper input validation. This could lead to local information disclosure if a malicious USB
    HID device were plugged in, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
    for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-188677105References: Upstream
    kernel (CVE-2022-20132)

  - In ip_check_mc_rcu of igmp.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could lead
    to local escalation of privilege when opening and closing inet sockets with no additional execution
    privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android
    kernelAndroid ID: A-112551163References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20141)

  - In lock_sock_nested of sock.c, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead
    to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
    for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-174846563References: Upstream
    kernel (CVE-2022-20154)

  - In various methods of kernel base drivers, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a heap buffer
    overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-182388481References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20166)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's KVM when attempting to set a SynIC IRQ. This issue makes it
    possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This
    flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel
    oops condition that results in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-2153)

  - There are use-after-free vulnerabilities caused by timer handler in net/rose/rose_timer.c of linux that
    allow attackers to crash linux kernel without any privileges. (CVE-2022-2318)

  - Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text
    explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and Network PV device
    frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740).
    Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to
    unrelated data residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being accessible by such backend
    (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742). (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740, CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)

  - Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local attacker to
    cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.18; version 4.14
    and later versions. (CVE-2022-29581)

  - The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path allows attackers
    to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag. (CVE-2022-30594)

  - net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able to create
    user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to
    a use-after-free. (CVE-2022-32250)

  - The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are
    used. This occurs because of use of Algorithm 4 ('Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm') of RFC 6056.
    (CVE-2022-32296)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.3 on powerpc 32-bit platforms. There is a buffer
    overflow in ptrace PEEKUSER and POKEUSER (aka PEEKUSR and POKEUSR) when accessing floating point
    registers. (CVE-2022-32981)

  - Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree
    to keep track of the foreign mappings. Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the
    related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be used by unprivileged guests via PV
    devices to cause inconsistencies of the rbtree. These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS)
    of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform further mappings of other guests' memory
    pages. (CVE-2022-33744)

  - drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of service, because of
    a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the raw_cmd_ioctl function.
    (CVE-2022-33981)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init
    (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an
    unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data
    in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. (CVE-2022-34918)
