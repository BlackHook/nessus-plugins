"According to the versions of the libtiff package installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - Null source pointer passed as an argument to memcpy() function within TIFFFetchStripThing() in
    tif_dirread.c in libtiff versions from 3.9.0 to 4.3.0 could lead to Denial of Service via crafted TIFF
    file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit eecb0712.
    (CVE-2022-0561)

  - Null source pointer passed as an argument to memcpy() function within TIFFReadDirectory() in tif_dirread.c
    in libtiff versions from 4.0 to 4.3.0 could lead to Denial of Service via crafted TIFF file. For users
    that compile libtiff from sources, a fix is available with commit 561599c. (CVE-2022-0562)

  - A heap buffer overflow in ExtractImageSection function in tiffcrop.c in libtiff library Version 4.3.0
    allows attacker to trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could
    result into application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact
    (CVE-2022-0891)

  - Null source pointer passed as an argument to memcpy() function within TIFFFetchNormalTag () in
    tif_dirread.c in libtiff versions up to 4.3.0 could lead to Denial of Service via crafted TIFF file.
    (CVE-2022-0908)

  - Out-of-bounds Read error in tiffcp in libtiff 4.3.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a
    crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 408976c4.
    (CVE-2022-0924)

  - A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffcp.c in main() function. This flaw allows an
    attacker to pass a crafted TIFF file to the tiffcp tool, triggering a stack buffer overflow issue,
    possibly corrupting the memory, and causing a crash that leads to a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1355)

  - Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a
    crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f3a5e010.
    (CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058)

  - LibTIFF 4.3.0 has an out-of-bounds read in _TIFFmemcpy in tif_unix.c in certain situations involving a
    custom tag and 0x0200 as the second word of the DE field. (CVE-2022-22844)

  - libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a uint32_t underflow that can lead to out of bounds read and write. An
    attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user to run tiffcrop on it with
    certain parameters) could cause a crash or in some cases, further exploitation. (CVE-2022-2867)

  - libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a improper input validation flaw that can lead to out of bounds read and
    ultimately cause a crash if an attacker is able to supply a crafted file to tiffcrop. (CVE-2022-2868)

  - libtiff's tiffcrop tool has a uint32_t underflow which leads to out of bounds read and write in the
    extractContigSamples8bits routine. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop could trigger this
    flaw, most likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted file with tiffcrop. Triggering this flaw
    could cause a crash or potentially further exploitation. (CVE-2022-2869)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds read in extractImageSection in tools/tiffcrop.c:6905, allowing
    attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from
    sources, the fix is available with commit 48d6ece8. (CVE-2022-2953)

  - Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff library Version 4.4.0 allows attacker to
    trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into
    application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact (CVE-2022-3570)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemcpy in libtiff/tif_unix.c:346 when called from
    extractImageSection, tools/tiffcrop.c:6826, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted
    tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.
    (CVE-2022-3597)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in extractContigSamplesShifted24bits in tools/tiffcrop.c:3604,
    allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff
    from sources, the fix is available with commit cfbb883b. (CVE-2022-3598)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds read in writeSingleSection in tools/tiffcrop.c:7345, allowing attackers
    to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix
    is available with commit e8131125. (CVE-2022-3599)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemset in libtiff/tif_unix.c:340 when called from
    processCropSelections, tools/tiffcrop.c:7619, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a
    crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.
    (CVE-2022-3626)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemcpy in libtiff/tif_unix.c:346 when called from
    extractImageSection, tools/tiffcrop.c:6860, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted
    tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.
