  script_set_attribute(attribute:"synopsis", value:
"The remote EulerOS Virtualization host is missing multiple security
updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the openssl packages installed, the
EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host is affected by
the following vulnerabilities :

  - A race condition was found in the session handling code
    of OpenSSL. This issue could possibly cause a
    multi-threaded TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to double
    free session ticket data and crash.(CVE-2015-1791)

  - An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the
    X509_cmp_time() function of OpenSSL, which is used to
    test the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates. An
    attacker could possibly use a specially crafted SSL/TLS
    certificate or CRL (Certificate Revocation List), which
    when parsed by an application would cause that
    application to crash.(CVE-2015-1789)

  - The ASN1_STRING_print_ex function in OpenSSL before
    0.9.8k allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (invalid memory access and application crash)
    via vectors that trigger printing of a (1) BMPString or
    (2) UniversalString with an invalid encoded
    length.(CVE-2009-0590)

  - An invalid-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL
    handled certain DTLS handshake messages. A malicious
    DTLS client or server could send a specially crafted
    message to the peer, which could cause the application
    to crash or potentially result in arbitrary code
    execution.(CVE-2014-8176)

  - The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and
    1.x before 1.0.0f performs a MAC check only if certain
    padding is valid, which makes it easier for remote
    attackers to recover plaintext via a padding oracle
    attack.(CVE-2011-4108)

  - Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function
    in OpenSSL 0.9.7 up to 0.9.7l, and 0.9.8 up to 0.9.8f,
    might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
    via a crafted packet that triggers a one-byte buffer
    underflow. NOTE: this issue was introduced as a result
    of a fix for CVE-2006-3738. As of 20071012, it is
    unknown whether code execution is
    possible.(CVE-2007-5135)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the DTLS
    implementation of OpenSSL. A remote attacker could send
    a specially crafted DTLS message, which would cause an
    OpenSSL server to crash.(CVE-2014-3571)

  - The asn1_d2i_read_bio function in
    crypto/asn1/a_d2i_fp.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8v, 1.0.0
    before 1.0.0i, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1a does not
    properly interpret integer data, which allows remote
    attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause
    a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
    have unspecified other impact, via crafted DER data, as
    demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA public
    key.(CVE-2012-2110)

  - It was discovered that the SSLv2 servers using OpenSSL
    accepted SSLv2 connection handshakes that indicated
    non-zero clear key length for non-export cipher suites.
    An attacker could use this flaw to decrypt recorded
    SSLv2 sessions with the server by using it as a
    decryption oracle.(CVE-2016-0703)

  - ssl/s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8i allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
    dereference and daemon crash) via a DTLS
    ChangeCipherSpec packet that occurs before
    ClientHello.(CVE-2009-1386)

  - Memory leak in the zlib_stateful_finish function in
    crypto/comp/c_zlib.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8l and earlier and
    1.0.0 Beta through Beta 4 allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via
    vectors that trigger incorrect calls to the
    CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data function, as demonstrated by
    use of SSLv3 and PHP with the Apache HTTP Server, a
    related issue to CVE-2008-1678.(CVE-2009-4355)

  - A flaw was discovered in the way OpenSSL handled DTLS
    packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause
    a DTLS server or client using OpenSSL to crash or use
    excessive amounts of memory.(CVE-2014-3507)

  - The dtls1_buffer_record function in ssl/d1_pkt.c in
    OpenSSL 0.9.8k and earlier 0.9.8 versions allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
    consumption) via a large series of 'future epoch' DTLS
    records that are buffered in a queue, aka 'DTLS record
    buffer limitation bug.'(CVE-2009-1377)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL
    imported malformed Elliptic Curve private keys. A
    specially crafted key file could cause an application
    using OpenSSL to crash when imported.(CVE-2015-0209)

  - A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL
    verified certain signed messages using CMS
    (Cryptographic Message Syntax). A remote attacker could
    cause an application using OpenSSL to use excessive
    amounts of memory by sending a specially crafted
    message for verification.(CVE-2015-1792)

  - A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL
    handled SSLv2 handshake messages. A remote attacker
    could use this flaw to cause a TLS/SSL server using
    OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both
    the SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites
    enabled.(CVE-2015-0293)

  - An invalid pointer use flaw was found in OpenSSL's
    ASN1_TYPE_cmp() function. A remote attacker could crash
    a TLS/SSL client or server using OpenSSL via a
    specially crafted X.509 certificate when the
    attacker-supplied certificate was verified by the
    application.(CVE-2015-0286)

  - Multiple flaws were found in the way OpenSSL parsed
    X.509 certificates. An attacker could use these flaws
    to modify an X.509 certificate to produce a certificate
    with a different fingerprint without invalidating its
    signature, and possibly bypass fingerprint-based
    blacklisting in applications.(CVE-2014-8275)

  - If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and
    then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a
    close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can
    respond differently to the calling application if a 0
    byte record is received with invalid padding compared
    to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC.
    If the application then behaves differently based on
    that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer,
    then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be
    used to decrypt data. In order for this to be
    exploitable 'non-stitched' ciphersuites must be in use.
    Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of
    certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the
    application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a
    protocol error has occurred (applications should not do
    this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r
    (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).(CVE-2019-1559)

  - A flaw was found in the way the TLS protocol composes
    the Diffie-Hellman exchange (for both export and
    non-export grade cipher suites). An attacker could use
    this flaw to downgrade a DHE connection to use
    export-grade key sizes, which could then be broken by
    sufficient pre-computation. This can lead to a passive
    man-in-the-middle attack in which the attacker is able
    to decrypt all traffic.(CVE-2015-4000)
