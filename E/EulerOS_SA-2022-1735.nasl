  script_set_attribute(attribute:"synopsis", value:
"The remote EulerOS host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by
the following vulnerabilities :

  - Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) allows reinstallation of the Group Temporal Key (GTK) during the
    group key handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to replay frames from access points to
    clients. (CVE-2017-13080)

  - It was found that cephx authentication protocol did not verify ceph clients correctly and was vulnerable
    to replay attack. Any attacker having access to ceph cluster network who is able to sniff packets on
    network can use this vulnerability to authenticate with ceph service and perform actions allowed by ceph
    service. Ceph branches master, mimic, luminous and jewel are believed to be vulnerable. (CVE-2018-1128)

  - The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent
    Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a
    network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP,
    CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
    (CVE-2020-24586)

  - The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent
    Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary
    can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP,
    CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed. (CVE-2020-24587)

  - The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent
    Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated.
    Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an
    adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets. (CVE-2020-24588)

  - An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames to other
    clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in
    projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier
    to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients. (CVE-2020-26139)

  - An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 6.1316.1209 for AWUS036H. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and
    WPA3 implementations accept plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can abuse this to
    inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration. (CVE-2020-26140)

  - An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 6.1316.1209 for AWUS036H. The Wi-Fi implementation
    does not verify the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames. An adversary can
    abuse this to inject and possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support the TKIP data-
    confidentiality protocol. (CVE-2020-26141)

  - An issue was discovered in the kernel in OpenBSD 6.6. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations treat
    fragmented frames as full frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets,
    independent of the network configuration. (CVE-2020-26142)

  - An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 1030.36.604 for AWUS036ACH. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and
    WPA3 implementations accept fragmented plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can
    abuse this to inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration. (CVE-2020-26143)

  - An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3
    implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as long as the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042
    (i.e., LLC/SNAP) header for EAPOL. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets
    independent of the network configuration. (CVE-2020-26144)

  - An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3
    implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and process
    them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets
    independent of the network configuration. (CVE-2020-26145)

  - An issue was discovered on Samsung Galaxy S3 i9305 4.4.4 devices. The WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations
    reassemble fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate
    selected fragments. This vulnerability is exploitable when another device sends fragmented frames and the
    WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. Note that WEP is vulnerable to this attack by
    design. (CVE-2020-26146)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.8.9. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble
    fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject
    packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP,
    CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. (CVE-2020-26147)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of MIDI, where an attacker with a local account and
    the permissions to issue ioctl commands to midi devices could trigger a use-after-free issue. A write to
    this specific memory while freed and before use causes the flow of execution to change and possibly allow
    for memory corruption or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
    confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2020-27786)

  - In unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible use after free bug due to a race condition. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found in the way users
    do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system.
    (CVE-2021-20321)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the ARM SIGPAGE functionality of Linux Kernel v5.4.66
    and v5.4.54. The latest version (5.11-rc4) seems to still be vulnerable. A userland application can read
    the contents of the sigpage, which can leak kernel memory contents. An attacker can read a process's
    memory at a specific offset to trigger this vulnerability. This was fixed in kernel releases: 4.14.222
    4.19.177 5.4.99 5.10.17 5.11 (CVE-2021-21781)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.3 when a webcam device exists. video_usercopy in
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c has a memory leak for large arguments, aka CID-fb18802a338b.
    (CVE-2021-30002)

  - Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow
    an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. (CVE-2021-33098)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on
    inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory. (CVE-2021-3655)

  - A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was
    found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.
    (CVE-2021-3679)

  - hso_free_net_device in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.4 calls unregister_netdev
    without checking for the NETREG_REGISTERED state, leading to a use-after-free and a double free.
    (CVE-2021-37159)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data corruption or loss
    can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value exceeding the buffer size. NOTE:
    the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the
    length validation was added solely for robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.
    (CVE-2021-38160)

  - net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_standalone.c in the Linux kernel before 5.12.2 allows observation of changes in
    any net namespace because these changes are leaked into all other net namespaces. This is related to the
    NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX, NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX, and NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS sysctls. (CVE-2021-38209)

  - A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the user maps some
    regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment with the fault of some of the
    memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized access to some data. (CVE-2021-4002)

  - A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket
    file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race
    condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
    This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4. (CVE-2021-4083)

  - A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an
    improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of
    service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem. (CVE-2021-4149)

  - An out of memory bounds write flaw (1 or 2 bytes of memory) in the Linux kernel NFS subsystem was found in
    the way users use mirroring (replication of files with NFS). A user, having access to the NFS mount, could
    potentially use this flaw to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system. (CVE-2021-4157)

  - An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and namespaces
    subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged process that are controlled by
    cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of
    control groups. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the
    system. (CVE-2021-4197)

  - In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows
    an attacker (who can connect a crafted USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).
    (CVE-2021-43976)

  - In gc_data_segment in fs/f2fs/gc.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.3, special files are not considered,
    leading to a move_data_page NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2021-44879)

  - In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an out-of-bounds
    memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. (CVE-2021-45469)

  - In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3, net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information
    leak because of certain use of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that IPv6-based
    attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source addresses. (CVE-2021-45485)

  - In the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.12.4, net/ipv4/route.c has an information leak
    because the hash table is very small. (CVE-2021-45486)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write().
    This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2022-1011)
