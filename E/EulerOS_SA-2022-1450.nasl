"The remote EulerOS host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by
the following vulnerabilities :

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel, where a use-after-frees in nouveau's postclose() handler could
    happen if removing device (that is not common to remove video card physically without power-off, but same
    happens if 'unbind' the driver). (CVE-2020-27820)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as 'driver domains'.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.7. usbip_sockfd_store in
    drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (GPF) because the stub-up
    sequence has race conditions during an update of the local and shared status, aka CID-9380afd6df70.
    (CVE-2021-29265)

  - An Out-of-Bounds Read was discovered in arch/arm/mach-footbridge/personal-pci.c in the Linux kernel
    through 5.12.11 because of the lack of a check for a value that shouldn't be negative, e.g., access to
    element -2 of an array, aka CID-298a58e165e4. (CVE-2021-32078)

  - Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow
    an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. (CVE-2021-33098)

  - In various setup methods of the USB gadget subsystem, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an
    incorrect flag check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution
    privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android
    kernelAndroid ID: A-210292376References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39685)

  - An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and namespaces
    subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged process that are controlled by
    cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of
    control groups. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the
    system. (CVE-2021-4197)

  - A use-after-free read flaw was found in sock_getsockopt() in net/core/sock.c due to SO_PEERCRED and
    SO_PEERGROUPS race with listen() (and connect()) in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, an attacker with a
    user privileges may crash the system or leak internal kernel information. (CVE-2021-4203)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3, net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information
    leak because of certain use of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that IPv6-based
    attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source addresses. (CVE-2021-45485)

  - A flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP network
    protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this flaw, an attempt to use more
    buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to a denial of service (DOS). (CVE-2022-0322)

  - A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the
    way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or
    escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-0330)

  - A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends
    a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed.
    This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have
    access to the TIPC network. (CVE-2022-0435)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)
