"The remote EulerOS host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected by
the following vulnerabilities :

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a
    privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the
    /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it
    can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms. (CVE-2021-3923)

  - In l2cap_chan_put of l2cap_core, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could
    lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-165329981References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20566)

  - An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel Intel's iSMT SMBus host controller
    driver in the way a user triggers the I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_DATA (with the ioctl I2C_SMBUS) with malicious input
    data. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system. (CVE-2022-2873)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SGI GRU driver in the way the first
    gru_file_unlocked_ioctl function is called by the user, where a fail pass occurs in the
    gru_check_chiplet_assignment function. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate
    their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-3424)

  - An incorrect read request flaw was found in the Infrared Transceiver USB driver in the Linux kernel. This
    issue occurs when a user attaches a malicious USB device. A local user could use this flaw to starve the
    resources, causing denial of service or potentially crashing the system. (CVE-2022-3903)

  - In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a use-after-free caused
    by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release. (CVE-2022-41218)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A missing lock when clearing
    sk_user_data can lead to a race condition and NULL pointer dereference. A local user could use this flaw
    to potentially crash the system causing a denial of service. (CVE-2022-4129)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking
    configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action 'mirred') a local unprivileged user
    could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a
    retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition. (CVE-2022-4269)

  - A flaw incorrect access control in the Linux kernel USB core subsystem was found in the way user attaches
    usb device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2022-4662)

  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows
    an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control
    configuration that is set up with 'tc qdisc' and 'tc class' commands. This affects qdisc_graft in
    net/sched/sch_api.c. (CVE-2022-47929)

  - A use after free vulnerability exists in the ALSA PCM package in the Linux Kernel.
    SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_{READ|WRITE}32 is missing locks that can be used in a use-after-free that can result
    in a priviledge escalation to gain ring0 access from the system user. We recommend upgrading past commit
    56b88b50565cd8b946a2d00b0c83927b7ebb055e (CVE-2023-0266)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network
    subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash. (CVE-2023-0394)

  - A memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel's human interface device (HID) subsystem in how a
    user inserts a malicious USB device. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their
    privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-1073)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol. This issue may
    occur when a user starts a malicious networking service and someone connects to this service. This could
    allow a local user to starve resources, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2023-1074)

  - In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the
    transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list
    -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2023-1095)

  - A flaw use after free in the Linux kernel integrated infrared receiver/transceiver driver was found in the
    way user detaching rc device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate
    their privileges on the system. (CVE-2023-1118)

  - Use After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege
    Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-
    after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this
    vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root. This issue affects Linux Kernel: from 4.14 before git
    commit ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2. (CVE-2023-1281)

  - A slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in brcmf_get_assoc_ies in
    drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux Kernel. This issue could occur
    when assoc_info->req_len data is bigger than the size of the buffer, defined as WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX, leading
    to a denial of service. (CVE-2023-1380)

  - A data race flaw was found in the Linux kernel, between where con is allocated and con->sock is set. This
    issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing con->sock->sk in net/tipc/topsrv.c in the tipc
    protocol in the Linux kernel. (CVE-2023-1382)

  - cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes
    indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23454)

  - atm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition
    rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23455)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the az6027 driver in drivers/media/usb/dev-usb/az6027.c in
    the Linux Kernel. The message from user space is not checked properly before transferring into the device.
    This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or potentially cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2023-28328)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3. lib/seq_buf.c has a seq_buf_putmem_hex buffer
    overflow. (CVE-2023-28772)
