  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the openssl111d packages installed, the EulerOS installation on the remote host is affected
by the following vulnerabilities :

  - The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This
    script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such
    operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of
    the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.
    Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd). (CVE-2022-1292)

  - In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances
    where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection
    were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other
    places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command
    executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is
    automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the
    privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the
    OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in
    OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze). (CVE-2022-2068)

  - AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt
    the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was
    preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of 'in place' encryption, sixteen bytes
    of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and
    DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q
    (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p). (CVE-2022-2097)

  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient
    to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
    decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.
    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS
    connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An
    attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
    trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number
    of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be
    able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. (CVE-2022-4304)

  - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the 'name' (e.g.
    'CERTIFICATE'), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the 'name_out',
    'header' and 'data' arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.
    The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results
    in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate
    the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this
    buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an
    attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service
    attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and
    therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a
    number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()
    which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the
    caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations
    include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL
    asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue. (CVE-2022-4450)
