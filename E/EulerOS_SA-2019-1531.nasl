"The remote EulerOS Virtualization for ARM 64 host is missing multiple security
updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the
EulerOS Virtualization for ARM 64 installation on the remote host is
affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz),
    the core of any Linux operating system. The kernel
    handles the basic functions of the operating system:
    memory allocation, process allocation, device input and
    output, etc.Security Fix(es):Use-after-free
    vulnerability in driverset/tun.c in the Linux kernel
    through 3.11.1 allows local users to gain privileges by
    leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability and providing
    an invalid tuntap interface name in a TUNSETIFF ioctl
    call.(CVE-2013-4343)It was found that when the gcc
    stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys
    file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to
    stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect
    buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value
    rendered as weeks.(CVE-2016-7042)A flaw was found in
    the Linux kernel that fs/ocfs2/aops.c omits use of a
    semaphore and consequently has a race condition for
    access to the extent tree during read operations in
    DIRECT mode. This allows local users to cause a denial
    of service by modifying a certain e_cpos
    field.(CVE-2017-18224)The sctp_v6_create_accept_sk
    function in net/sctp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel
    mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to
    cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
    other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue
    to CVE-2017-8890. An unprivileged local user could use
    this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the
    system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the
    flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out,
    although we believe it is unlikely.(CVE-2017-9075)In
    the function sbusfb_ioctl_helper() in
    drivers/video/fbdev/sbuslib.c in the Linux kernel, up
    to and including 4.15, an integer signedness error
    allows arbitrary information leakage for the
    FBIOPUTCMAP_SPARC and FBIOGETCMAP_SPARC
    commands.(CVE-2018-6412)A race condition flaw was found
    in the way the Linux kernel's mmap(2), madvise(2), and
    fallocate(2) system calls interacted with each other
    while operating on virtual memory file system files. A
    local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of
    service.(CVE-2014-4171)** RESERVED ** This candidate
    has been reserved by an organization or individual that
    will use it when announcing a new security problem.
    When the candidate has been publicized, the details for
    this candidate will be provided.(CVE-2018-1095)A NULL
    pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux
    kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
    implementation handled simultaneous connections between
    the same hosts. A remote attacker could use this flaw
    to crash the system.(CVE-2014-5077)A vulnerability was
    found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function
    logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to
    create files with an unintended group ownership and
    with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a
    scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a
    certain group and is writable by a user who is not a
    member of this group. This can lead to excessive
    permissions granted in case when they should
    not.(CVE-2018-13405)In the Linux kernel before 4.20.8,
    kvm_ioctl_create_device in virt/kvm/kvm_main.c
    mishandles reference counting because of a race
    condition, leading to a use-after-free.(CVE-2019-6974)A
    flaw was found in the way Linux kernel allocates heap
    memory to build the scattergather list from a fragment
    list(skb_shinfo(skb)-i1/4zfrag_list) in the socket
    buffer(skb_buff). The heap overflow occurred if
    'MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1' parameter and 'NETIF_F_FRAGLIST'
    feature are both used together. A remote user or
    process could use this flaw to potentially escalate
    their privilege on a system.(CVE-2017-7477)Multiple
    integer overflows in Alchemy LCD frame-buffer drivers
    in the Linux kernel before 3.12 allow local users to
    create a read-write memory mapping for the entirety of
    kernel memory, and consequently gain privileges, via
    crafted mmap operations, related to the (1)
    au1100fb_fb_mmap function in drivers/video/au1100fb.c
    and the (2) au1200fb_fb_mmap function in
    drivers/video/au1200fb.c.(CVE-2013-4511)It was found
    that in the Linux kernel through v4.14-rc5,
    bio_map_user_iov() and bio_unmap_user() in
    'block/bio.c' do unbalanced pages refcounting if IO
    vector has small consecutive buffers belonging to the
    same page. bio_add_pc_page() merges them into one, but
    the page reference is never dropped, causing a memory
    leak and possible system lockup due to out-of-memory
    condition.(CVE-2017-12190)An issue was discovered in
    the Linux kernel before 4.19.3. crypto_report_one() and
    related functions in crypto/crypto_user.c (the crypto
    user configuration API) do not fully initialize
    structures that are copied to userspace, potentially
    leaking sensitive memory to user programs. NOTE: this
    is a CVE-2013-2547 regression but with easier
    exploitability because the attacker does not need a
    capability (however, the system must have the
    CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER kconfig option).(CVE-2018-19854)The
    userfaultfd implementation in the Linux kernel before
    4.19.7 mishandles access control for certain UFFDIO_
    ioctl calls, as demonstrated by allowing local users to
    write data into holes in a tmpfs file (if the user has
    read-only access to that file, and that file contains
    holes), related to fs/userfaultfd.c and
    mm/userfaultfd.c.(CVE-2018-18397)The TCP stack in the
    Linux kernel through 4.10.6 mishandles the
    SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS feature, which allows local
    users to obtain sensitive information from the kernel's
    internal socket data structures or cause a denial of
    service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted system calls,
    related to net/core/skbuff.c and
    net/socket.c.(CVE-2017-7277)A flaw was found in the way
    the Linux kernel's vhost driver treated userspace
    provided log file descriptor when processing the
    VHOST_SET_LOG_FD ioctl command. The file descriptor was
    never released and continued to consume kernel memory.
    A privileged local user with access to the
    /dev/vhost-net files could use this flaw to create a
    denial-of-service attack.(CVE-2015-6252)A buffer
    overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
    virtio-net subsystem handled certain fraglists when the
    GRO (Generic Receive Offload) functionality was enabled
    in a bridged network configuration. An attacker on the
    local network could potentially use this flaw to crash
    the system, or, although unlikely, elevate their
    privileges on the system.(CVE-2015-5156)The MSM QDSP6
    audio driver (aka sound driver) for the Linux kernel
    3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC)
    Android contributions for MSM devices and other
    products, allows attackers to gain privileges or cause
    a denial of service (integer overflow, and buffer
    overflow or buffer over-read) via a crafted application
    that performs a (1) AUDIO_EFFECTS_WRITE or (2)
    AUDIO_EFFECTS_READ operation, aka Qualcomm internal bug
    CR1006609.(CVE-2016-2068)The icmp6_send function in
    net/ipv6/icmp.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.12
    omits a certain check of the dst data structure which
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (panic) via a fragmented IPv6 packet.(CVE-2016-9919)
