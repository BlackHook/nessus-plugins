  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - In memzero_explicit of compiler-clang.h, there is a possible bypass of defense in depth due to
    uninitialized data. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution
    privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android
    kernelAndroid ID: A-171418586References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0938)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as used in Xen. Block, net, and SCSI
    backends consider certain errors a plain bug, deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially
    being at least under the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn't correct to
    assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing such crashes occur only when Linux is running
    in PV mode, though. This affects drivers/block/xen-blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.
    (CVE-2021-26931)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - arch/x86/kvm/mmu/paging_tmpl.h in the Linux kernel before 5.12.11 incorrectly computes the access
    permissions of a shadow page, leading to a missing guest protection page fault. (CVE-2021-38198)

  - In gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show of configfs.c, there is a possible disclosure of kernel heap memory due to a
    race condition. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-160822094References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39648)

  - In ufshcd_eh_device_reset_handler of ufshcd.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a missing
    bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with System execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-194696049References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39657)

  - In aio_poll_complete_work of aio.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-185125206References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39698)

  - In gc_data_segment in fs/f2fs/gc.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.3, special files are not considered,
    leading to a move_data_page NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2021-44879)

  - In the Linux kernel before 5.15.3, fs/quota/quota_tree.c does not validate the block number in the quota
    tree (on disk). This can, for example, lead to a kernel/locking/rwsem.c use-after-free if there is a
    corrupted quota file. (CVE-2021-45868)

  - A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends
    a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed.
    This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have
    access to the TIPC network. (CVE-2022-0435)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in
    the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or
    CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with confidentiality. (CVE-2022-0494)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls DMA_FROM_DEVICE.
    This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel space. (CVE-2022-0854)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write().
    This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2022-1011)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 5.16.8 mishandles dev->buf release.
    (CVE-2022-24958)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The USB
    Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor requests (ones with a large array
    index and ones associated with NULL function pointer retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.
    (CVE-2022-25258)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - st21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c in the Linux kernel through 5.16.12 has
    EVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length parameters. (CVE-2022-26490)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12. drivers/net/usb/sr9700.c allows attackers to
    obtain sensitive information from heap memory via crafted frame lengths from a device. (CVE-2022-26966)

  - In drivers/usb/gadget/udc/udc-xilinx.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12, the endpoint index is not
    validated and might be manipulated by the host for out-of-array access. (CVE-2022-27223)

  - A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c and
    net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap
    objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat. (CVE-2022-27666)
