  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - Resource leak in i40e driver for Intel(R) Ethernet 700 Series Controllers versions before 2.8.43 may allow
    an authenticated user to potentially enable a denial of service via local access. (CVE-2019-0146)

  - Resource leak in i40e driver for Intel(R) Ethernet 700 Series Controllers versions before 7.0 may allow an
    authenticated user to potentially enable a denial of service via local access. (CVE-2019-0148)

  - Insufficient input validation in i40e driver for Intel(R) Ethernet 700 Series Controllers versions before
    2.8.43 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable a denial of service via local access.
    (CVE-2019-0149)

  - A race condition in the Linux kernel before 5.6.2 between the VT_DISALLOCATE ioctl and closing/opening of
    ttys could lead to a use-after-free. (CVE-2020-36557)

  - A race condition in the Linux kernel before 5.5.7 involving VT_RESIZEX could lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference and general protection fault. (CVE-2020-36558)

  - Insufficient control flow management for the Intel(R) 82599 Ethernet Controllers and Adapters may allow an
    authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. (CVE-2021-33061)

  - When sending malicous data to kernel by ioctl cmd FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO,kernel will write memory out of
    bounds. (CVE-2021-33655)

  - When setting font with malicous data by ioctl cmd PIO_FONT,kernel will write memory out of bounds.
    (CVE-2021-33656)

  - An information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c in the Linux
    Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak kernel information.
    (CVE-2022-0812)

  - A vulnerability was found in linux kernel, where an information leak occurs via ext4_extent_header to
    userspace. (CVE-2022-0850)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernel's filesystem sub-
    component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2022-1184)

  - An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TeleTYpe subsystem. The issue occurs in how a
    user triggers a race condition using ioctls TIOCSPTLCK and TIOCGPTPEER and TIOCSTI and TCXONC with leakage
    of memory in the flush_to_ldisc function. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or read
    unauthorized random data from memory. (CVE-2022-1462)

  - In lock_sock_nested of sock.c, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead
    to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
    for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-174846563References: Upstream
    kernel (CVE-2022-20154)

  - In various methods of kernel base drivers, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a heap buffer
    overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-182388481References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20166)

  - Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-224546354References: Upstream kernel
    (CVE-2022-20368)

  - In verity_target of dm-verity-target.c, there is a possible way to modify read-only files due to a missing
    permission check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges
    needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid
    ID: A-234475629References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20572)

  - Dm-verity is used for extending root-of-trust to root filesystems. LoadPin builds on this property to
    restrict module/firmware loads to just the trusted root filesystem. Device-mapper table reloads currently
    allow users with root privileges to switch out the target with an equivalent dm-linear target and bypass
    verification till reboot. This allows root to bypass LoadPin and can be used to load untrusted and
    unverified kernel modules and firmware, which implies arbitrary kernel execution and persistence for
    peripherals that do not verify firmware updates. We recommend upgrading past commit
    4caae58406f8ceb741603eee460d79bacca9b1b5 (CVE-2022-2503)

  - An integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of
    actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size()
    function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This
    flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-2639)

  - An issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and
    incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted
    IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured. (CVE-2022-2663)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet
    Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes.
    (CVE-2022-2964)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel implementation of proxied virtualized TPM devices. On a system where
    virtualized TPM devices are configured (this is not the default) a local attacker can create a use-after-
    free and create a situation where it may be possible to escalate privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-2977)

  - A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem)
    when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to
    potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read
    and copying it into a socket. (CVE-2022-3028)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in nft_set_elem_init
    (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to escalate privileges, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can obtain root access, but must start with an
    unprivileged user namespace to obtain CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data
    in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c. (CVE-2022-34918)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this
    vulnerability is the function ipv6_renew_options of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to
    memory leak. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
    The identifier VDB-211021 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3524)

  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability
    is the function area_cache_get of the file drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the
    component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this
    issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3545)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this issue
    is the function del_timer of the file drivers/isdn/mISDN/l1oip_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The
    manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier
    of this vulnerability is VDB-211088. (CVE-2022-3565)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Linux Kernel. This affects the function
    tcp_getsockopt/tcp_setsockopt of the component TCP Handler. The manipulation leads to race condition. It
    is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211089 was assigned to this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3566)

  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects
    the function inet6_stream_ops/inet6_dgram_ops of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to
    race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211090 is the identifier
    assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3567)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb
    enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed)
    into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of
    service. (CVE-2022-3586)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this
    vulnerability is the function intr_callback of the file drivers/net/usb/r8152.c of the component BPF. The
    manipulation leads to logging of excessive data. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to
    apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211363.
    (CVE-2022-3594)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects
    the function vsock_connect of the file net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It
    is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211930 is the identifier assigned to this
    vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3629)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14. xfrm_expand_policies in
    net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c can cause a refcount to be dropped twice. (CVE-2022-36879)

  - nfqnl_mangle in net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because, in the case of an nf_queue verdict with a one-byte
    nfta_payload attribute, an skb_pull can encounter a negative skb->len. (CVE-2022-36946)

  - An issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race
    condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale
    TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs. (CVE-2022-39188)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A missing lock when clearing
    sk_user_data can lead to a race condition and NULL pointer dereference. A local user could use this flaw
    to potentially crash the system causing a denial of service. (CVE-2022-4129)

  - roccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition
    and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a
    report->value is in progress. (CVE-2022-41850)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A NULL pointer dereference may occur while a slip driver is in
    progress to detach in sl_tx_timeout in drivers/net/slip/slip.c. This issue could allow an attacker to
    crash the system or leak internal kernel information. (CVE-2022-41858)

  - mm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.7 has a use-after-free related to leaf anon_vma double reuse.
    (CVE-2022-42703)

  - drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-
    space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory. (CVE-2022-43750)

  - A flaw incorrect access control in the Linux kernel USB core subsystem was found in the way user attaches
    usb device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2022-4662)

  - In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows
    an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control
    configuration that is set up with 'tc qdisc' and 'tc class' commands. This affects qdisc_graft in
    net/sched/sch_api.c. (CVE-2022-47929)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c in the network
    subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash. (CVE-2023-0394)

  - cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes
    indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23454)

  - atm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to cause a denial
    of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition
    rather than valid classification results). (CVE-2023-23455)

  - A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Linux Kernel (Operating System) (affected version
    unknown). Affected by this vulnerability is some unknown processing of the component Cache Handler. There
    is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object
    with an alternative product. (CVE-2022-20565)

  - kernel: nf_tables cross-table potential use-after-free may lead to local privilege escalation
    (CVE-2022-2586)

  - kernel: a use-after-free in cls_route filter implementation may lead to privilege escalation
    (CVE-2022-2588)
