  script_set_attribute(attribute:"synopsis", value:
"The remote EulerOS Virtualization host is missing multiple security updates.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the versions of the kernel packages installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux kernel, where a use-after-frees in nouveau's postclose() handler could
    happen if removing device (that is not common to remove video card physically without power-off, but same
    happens if 'unbind' the driver). (CVE-2020-27820)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used with Xen through 4.14.x. The Linux
    kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped.
    However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect
    and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving
    guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege
    escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback.
    (CVE-2020-29569)

  - Rogue backends can cause DoS of guests via high frequency events T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Xen offers the
    ability to run PV backends in regular unprivileged guests, typically referred to as 'driver domains'.
    Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets
    compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain
    could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in
    the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected
    backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch
    3, CVE-2021-28713 (CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713)

  - Improper input validation in the Intel(R) Ethernet ixgbe driver for Linux before version 3.17.3 may allow
    an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. (CVE-2021-33098)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing SCTP
    association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port numbers being used and
    the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2021-3772)

  - In gre_handle_offloads of ip_gre.c, there is a possible page fault due to an invalid memory access. This
    could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-150694665References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39633)

  - In various setup methods of the USB gadget subsystem, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an
    incorrect flag check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution
    privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android
    kernelAndroid ID: A-210292376References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39685)

  - In aio_poll_complete_work of aio.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to a use after free. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-185125206References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-39698)

  - An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and namespaces
    subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged process that are controlled by
    cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of
    control groups. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the
    system. (CVE-2021-4197)

  - A use-after-free read flaw was found in sock_getsockopt() in net/core/sock.c due to SO_PEERCRED and
    SO_PEERGROUPS race with listen() (and connect()) in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, an attacker with a
    user privileges may crash the system or leak internal kernel information. (CVE-2021-4203)

  - A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11.
    This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an attempt to free a shared memory
    object. (CVE-2021-44733)

  - In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3, net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information
    leak because of certain use of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that IPv6-based
    attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source addresses. (CVE-2021-45485)

  - A flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the SCTP network
    protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this flaw, an attempt to use more
    buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to a denial of service (DOS). (CVE-2022-0322)

  - A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends
    a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed.
    This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have
    access to the TIPC network. (CVE-2022-0435)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c
    in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local attacker with a user privilege may impact system
    Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.14 rc1. (CVE-2022-0487)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way
    user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. (CVE-2022-0617)

  - A flaw was found in the way the 'flags' member of the new pipe buffer structure was lacking proper
    initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the Linux kernel and could thus
    contain stale values. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache
    backed by read only files and as such escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-0847)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE filesystem in the way a user triggers write().
    This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from the FUSE filesystem, resulting in
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2022-1011)

  - An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the
    O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a
    regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file
    descriptor. (CVE-2022-24448)

  - An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The
    RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command. Attackers can obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory. (CVE-2022-25375)

  - st21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c in the Linux kernel through 5.16.12 has
    EVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length parameters. (CVE-2022-26490)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12. drivers/net/usb/sr9700.c allows attackers to
    obtain sensitive information from heap memory via crafted frame lengths from a device. (CVE-2022-26966)

  - In drivers/usb/gadget/udc/udc-xilinx.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.12, the endpoint index is not
    validated and might be manipulated by the host for out-of-array access. (CVE-2022-27223)

  - A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c and
    net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to overwrite kernel heap
    objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat. (CVE-2022-27666)

  - kernel: xfs: raw block device data leak in XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL (CVE-2021-4155)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's EBPF verifier when handling internal data structures.
    Internal memory locations could be returned to userspace. A local attacker with the permissions to insert
    eBPF code to the kernel can use this to leak internal kernel memory details defeating some of the exploit
    mitigations in place for the kernel. (CVE-2021-4159)

  - kernel: failing usercopy allows for use-after-free exploitation (CVE-2022-22942)
