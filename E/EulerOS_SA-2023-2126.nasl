"According to the versions of the libtiff package installed, the EulerOS Virtualization installation on the remote host
is affected by the following vulnerabilities :

  - Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a
    crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f3a5e010.
    (CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058)

  - There is a double free or corruption in rotateImage() at tiffcrop.c:8839 found in libtiff 4.4.0rc1
    (CVE-2022-2519)

  - A flaw was found in libtiff 4.4.0rc1. There is a sysmalloc assertion fail in rotateImage() at
    tiffcrop.c:8621 that can cause program crash when reading a crafted input. (CVE-2022-2520)

  - It was found in libtiff 4.4.0rc1 that there is an invalid pointer free operation in TIFFClose() at
    tif_close.c:131 called by tiffcrop.c:2522 that can cause a program crash and denial of service while
    processing crafted input. (CVE-2022-2521)

  - A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of Tiffsplit v4.4.0. This vulnerability
    allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file parsed by the 'tiffsplit' or
    'tiffcrop' utilities. (CVE-2022-34526)

  - Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff library Version 4.4.0 allows attacker to
    trigger unsafe or out of bounds memory access via crafted TIFF image file which could result into
    application crash, potential information disclosure or any other context-dependent impact (CVE-2022-3570)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemcpy in libtiff/tif_unix.c:346 when called from
    extractImageSection, tools/tiffcrop.c:6826, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted
    tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.
    (CVE-2022-3597)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in extractContigSamplesShifted24bits in tools/tiffcrop.c:3604,
    allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff
    from sources, the fix is available with commit cfbb883b. (CVE-2022-3598)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds read in writeSingleSection in tools/tiffcrop.c:7345, allowing attackers
    to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix
    is available with commit e8131125. (CVE-2022-3599)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemset in libtiff/tif_unix.c:340 when called from
    processCropSelections, tools/tiffcrop.c:7619, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a
    crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.
    (CVE-2022-3626)

  - LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemcpy in libtiff/tif_unix.c:346 when called from
    extractImageSection, tools/tiffcrop.c:6860, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted
    tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191.
    (CVE-2022-3627)

  - A vulnerability was found in LibTIFF. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function
    TIFFReadRGBATileExt of the file libtiff/tif_getimage.c. The manipulation leads to integer overflow. It is
    possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
    The name of the patch is 227500897dfb07fb7d27f7aa570050e62617e3be. It is recommended to apply a patch to
    fix this issue. The identifier VDB-213549 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3970)

  - processCropSelections in tools/tiffcrop.c in LibTIFF through 4.5.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow (e.g.,
    'WRITE of size 307203') via a crafted TIFF image. (CVE-2022-48281)
