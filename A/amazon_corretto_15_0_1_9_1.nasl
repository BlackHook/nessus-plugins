  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Serialization).
    Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8 and 15; Java SE Embedded: 8u261.
    Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple
    protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded.
    Note: Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through
    sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying
    data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed
    Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.7 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). (CVE-2020-14779)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: JNDI). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8 and 15; Java SE Embedded: 8u261. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: Applies to client and server
    deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and
    sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component
    without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web
    service. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.7 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector:
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). (CVE-2020-14781)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8 and 15; Java SE Embedded: 8u261. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: Applies to
    client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the
    specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as
    through a web service. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.7 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N). (CVE-2020-14782, CVE-2020-14797)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8 and 15; Java SE Embedded: 8u261. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other
    than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or
    delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to
    a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: Applies to client and server deployment of
    Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java
    applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using
    sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.1

    typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
    and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
    security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
