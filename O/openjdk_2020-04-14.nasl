Please Note: Java CVEs do not always include OpenJDK versions, but are confirmed separately by Tenable using the patch
versions from the referenced OpenJDK security advisory.

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u251, 8u241, 11.0.6 and 14; Java SE Embedded: 8u241. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other
    than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly
    impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE,
    Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
    sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g.,
    code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not
    apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
    by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS
    Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). (CVE-2020-2803, CVE-2020-2805)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported versions that are
    affected are Java SE: 11.0.6 and 14. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
    network access via HTTPS to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE accessible data.
    Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component
    without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web
    service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.5 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
    (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N). (CVE-2020-2816)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u251, 8u241, 11.0.6 and 14; Java SE Embedded: 8u241. Easily
    exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTPS to compromise Java
    SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause
    a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: Applies to client and server
    deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and
    sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component
    without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web
    service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
    (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). (CVE-2020-2781)

    Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u251, 8u241, 11.0.6 and 14; Java SE Embedded: 8u241.
    Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple
    protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded.
    Note: Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through
    sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported versions that are
    affected are Java SE: 11.0.6 and 14. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
    with network access via HTTPS to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result
    in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized
    read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note: Applies to client and server deployment of Java.
    This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java
    applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using
    sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0
