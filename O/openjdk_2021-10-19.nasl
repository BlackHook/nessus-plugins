  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component:
    Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM
    Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and 21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker
    with network access via Kerberos to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful
    attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in
    Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
    Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete
    access to all Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies
    to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
    applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java
    sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component,
    e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 6.8 (Confidentiality
    impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N). (CVE-2021-35567)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component:
    JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u311, 8u301, 11.0.12; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise
    Edition: 20.3.3 and 21.2.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
    network access via TLS to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of
    this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE,
    Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
    typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
    and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
    security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through
    a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.9 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS
    Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). (CVE-2021-35550)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component:

    Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and 21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
    with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition.
    Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of
    service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability applies to
    Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
    applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java
    sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component,
    e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3 (Availability
    impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). (CVE-2021-35586)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component:
