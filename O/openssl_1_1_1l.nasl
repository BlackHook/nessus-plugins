"The version of OpenSSL installed on the remote host is prior to 1.1.1l. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as
referenced in the 1.1.1l advisory.

  - In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
    EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the
    out parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the outlen parameter is populated with the buffer size
    required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer
    and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the out parameter. A bug
    in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to
    hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size
    required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the
    application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2
    content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to
    a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing
    application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application
    dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).
    (CVE-2021-3711)

  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a
    buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings
    which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not
    a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar
    parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will
    additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for
    applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array
    by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using
    the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to
    assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for
    strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be
    printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the
    application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing
    can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been
    directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the
    certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the
    X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an
    application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL
    functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).
    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive
    plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2y). (CVE-2021-3712)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.");
