"This update for cf-cli fixes the following issues :

cf-cli was updated: to version 6.43.0 (bsc#1132242)

Enhancements :

  - `cf curl` supports a new `--fail` flag (primarily for
    scripting purposes) which returns exit code `22` for
    server errors
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/130060
    949)

  - Improves `cf delete-orphaned-routes` such that it uses a
    different endpoint, reducing the chance of a race
    condition when two users are simultaneously deleting
    orphaned routes and associating routes with applications
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/163156
    064)

  - we've improved the speed of cf services - it now hits a
    single endpoint instead of making individual API calls

Security :

  - CVE-2019-3781: CF CLI does not sanitize user&rsquo;s
    password in verbose/trace/debug.

  - Fixes issue with running cf login in verbose mode
    whereby passwords which contains regex were not
    completely redacted

  - Fixes issue whilst running commands in verbose mode
    refresh tokens were not completely redacted

Other Bug Fixes :

  - Updates help text for cf curlstory

  - Now refresh tokens work properly whilst using cf curl
    with V3 CC API endpoints story

  - Fixes performance degradation for cf services story

  - cf delete-service requires that you are targeting a
    space story

  - cf enable-service access for a service in an org will
    succeed if you have already enabled access for that
    service in that org story

cf-cli was updated to version 6.42.0 :

Minor Enhancements :

  - updated `cf restage` help text and the first line in the
    command's output to indicate that using this command
    will cause app downtime
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151841
    382)

  - updated the `cf bind-route-service` help text to clarify
    usage instructions
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/150111
    078)

  - improved an error message for `cf create-service-boker`
    to be more helpful when the CC API returns a `502` due
    to an invalid service broker catalog 

  - upgraded to Golang 1.11.4
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162745
    359)

  - added a short name `ue` for `cf unset-env`
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161632
    713)

  - updated `cf marketplace` command to include a new
    `broker` column to prepare for a upcoming
    services-related feature which will allow services to
    have the same name as long as they are associated with
    different service brokers
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162699
    756)

Bugs :

  - fix for `cf enable-service-access -p plan` whereby when
    we refactored the code in CLI `v6.41.0` it created
    service plan visibilities as part of a subsequent run of
    the command (the unrefactored code skipped creating the
    service plan visibilities); now the command will skip
    creating service plan visibilities as it did prior to
    the refactor
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162747
    373)

  - updated the `cf rename-buildpack` help text which was
    missing reference to the `-s` stack flag
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162428
    661)

  - updated help text for when users use `brew search
    cloudfoundry-cli`
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161770
    940)

  - now when you run `cf service service-instance` for a
    route service, the route service url appears in the key
    value table
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162498
    211)

Update to version 6.41.0 :

Enhancements :

  - updated `cf --help` to include the `delete` command
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161556
    511)

Update to version 6.40.1 :

Bug Fixes :

  - Updates the minimum version for the buildpacks-stacks
    association feature. In [CLI
    v6.39.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/ta
    g/v6.39.0), when the feature was released, we
    incorrectly set the minimum to cc api version as`2.114`.
    The minimum cc api version is now correctly set to
    [`2.112`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/r
    eleases/tag/1.58.0).
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161464
    797)

  - Fixes a bug with inspecting a service instance `cf
    service service-instance`, now the `documentation` url
    displays correctly for services which populate that
    field
    [story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161251
    875)

Update to version 6.40.0 :

Bug Fixes :

  - Fix bug where trailing slash on cf api would break
    listing commands for older CC APIs story. For older
    versions of CC API, if the API URL had a trailing slash,
    some requests would fail with an 'Unknown request'
    error. These requests are now handled properly.

Update to version 6.39.0 :

Enhancements :

  - for users on cc api 3.27, cf start is enhanced to
    display the new cf app v3 output. For users on cc api
    3.27 or lower, users will see the same v2 output. Note
    that if you use v3 commands to create and start your
    app, if you subsequently use cf stop and cf start, the
    routes property in cf app will not populate even though
    the route exists story

  - for users on cc api 3.27, cf restart is enhanced to
    display the new cf app v3 output. For users on cc api
    3.27 or lower, users will see the same v2 output. story

  - for users on cc api 3.27, cf restage is enhanced to
    display the new cf app v3 output. For users on cc api
    3.27 or lower, users will see the same v2 output. story

  - improved help text for -d domains for cf push to include
    examples of usage story

  - cf v3-scale displays additional app information story

  - if you've created an internal domain, and it is the
    first domain in cc, the CLI will now ignore the internal
    domain and instead choose the next non-internal domain
    when you push an app story

Bug Fixes :

  - Fix for users on macOS attempting to brew install cf-cli
    the CF CLI using the unreleased master branch of
    Homebrew story

  - Fixes an issue whereby, due to a recent cc api change,
    when you execute cf push and watch the cf app command,
    the app display returned a 400 error story

  - Fixes a bug whereby if you logged in using client
    credentials, cf auth user pass --client credentials you
    were unable to create an org; now create-org will assign
    the role to the user id specified in your manifest story

  - fixes an issue introduced when we refactored cf start
    and as part of that work, we stopped blocking on the
    initial connection with the logging backend; now the CLI
    blocks until the NOAA connection is made, or the default
    dial timeout of five seconds is reached story

update to version 6.38.0 :

Enhancements :

  - v3-ssh process type now defaults to web story

  - Support added for setting tags for user provided service
    instances story

  - Now a warning appears if you attempt to use deprecated
    properties and variable substitution story

  - Updated usage so now you can rename the cf binary use it
    with every command story

  - cf events now displays the Diego cell_id and instance
    guid in crash events story

  - Includes cf service service-instance table display
    improvements wherein the service instance information is
    now grouped separately from the binding information
    story

  - cf service service-instance table display information
    for user provided services changed: status has been
    added to the table story

Bug Fixes :

  - the CLI now properly handles escaped commas in the
    X-Cf-Warnings header

Update to version 6.37.0 :

Enhancements

  - The api/cloudcontroller/ccv2 package has been updated
    with more functions #1343

  - Now a warning appears if you are using a API version
    older than 2.69.0, which is no longer officially
    supported

  - Now the CLI reads the username and password from the
    environment variables #1358

Bug Fixes :

  - Fixes bug whereby X-Cf-Warnings were not being unescaped
    when displayed to user #1361

  - When using CF_TRACE=1, passwords are now sanitized #1375
    and tracker

Update to version 6.36.0 :

  - int64 support for cf/flags library, #1333

  - Debian package, #1336

  - Web action flag not working on CLI 0.6.5, #1337
