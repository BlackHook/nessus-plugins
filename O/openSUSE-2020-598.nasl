"This update for git fixes the following issues :

Security issues fixed :

  - CVE-2020-11008: Specially crafted URLs may have tricked
    the credentials helper to providing credential
    information that is not appropriate for the protocol in
    use and host being contacted (bsc#1169936)

git was updated to 2.26.1 (bsc#1169786, jsc#ECO-1628, bsc#1149792)

  - Fix git-daemon not starting after conversion from
    sysvinit to systemd service (bsc#1169605).

  - CVE-2020-5260: Specially crafted URLs with newline
    characters could have been used to make the Git client
    to send credential information for a wrong host to the
    attacker's site bsc#1168930

git 2.26.0 (bsc#1167890, jsc#SLE-11608) :

  - 'git rebase' now uses a different backend that is based
    on the 'merge' machinery by default. The
    'rebase.backend' configuration variable reverts to old
    behaviour when set to 'apply'

  - Improved handling of sparse checkouts

  - Improvements to many commands and internal features

git 2.25.2 :

  - bug fixes to various subcommands in specific operations

git 2.25.1 :

  - 'git commit' now honors advise.statusHints

  - various updates, bug fixes and documentation updates

git 2.25.0

  - The branch description ('git branch --edit-description')
    has been used to fill the body of the cover letters by
    the format-patch command; this has been enhanced so that
    the subject can also be filled.

  - A few commands learned to take the pathspec from the
    standard input or a named file, instead of taking it as
    the command line arguments, with the
    '--pathspec-from-file' option.

  - Test updates to prepare for SHA-2 transition continues.

  - Redo 'git name-rev' to avoid recursive calls.

  - When all files from some subdirectory were renamed to
    the root directory, the directory rename heuristics
    would fail to detect that as a rename/merge of the
    subdirectory to the root directory, which has been
    corrected.

  - HTTP transport had possible allocator/deallocator
    mismatch, which has been corrected.

git 2.24.1 :

  - CVE-2019-1348: The --export-marks option of fast-import
    is exposed also via the in-stream command feature
    export-marks=... and it allows overwriting arbitrary
    paths (bsc#1158785)

  - CVE-2019-1349: on Windows, when submodules are cloned
    recursively, under certain circumstances Git could be
    fooled into using the same Git directory twice
    (bsc#1158787)

  - CVE-2019-1350: Incorrect quoting of command-line
    arguments allowed remote code execution during a
    recursive clone in conjunction with SSH URLs
    (bsc#1158788)

  - CVE-2019-1351: on Windows mistakes drive letters outside
    of the US-English alphabet as relative paths
    (bsc#1158789)

  - CVE-2019-1352: on Windows was unaware of NTFS Alternate
    Data Streams (bsc#1158790)

  - CVE-2019-1353: when run in the Windows Subsystem for
    Linux while accessing a working directory on a regular
    Windows drive, none of the NTFS protections were active
    (bsc#1158791)

  - CVE-2019-1354: on Windows refuses to write tracked files
    with filenames that contain backslashes (bsc#1158792)

  - CVE-2019-1387: Recursive clones vulnerability that is
    caused by too-lax validation of submodule names,
    allowing very targeted attacks via remote code execution
    in recursive clones (bsc#1158793)

  - CVE-2019-19604: a recursive clone followed by a
    submodule update could execute code contained within the
    repository without the user explicitly having asked for
    that (bsc#1158795)

git 2.24.0

  - The command line parser learned '--end-of-options'
    notation.

  - A mechanism to affect the default setting for a
    (related) group of configuration variables is
    introduced.

  - 'git fetch' learned '--set-upstream' option to help
    those who first clone from their private fork they
    intend to push to, add the true upstream via 'git remote
    add' and then 'git fetch' from it.

  - fixes and improvements to UI, workflow and features,
    bash completion fixes

git 2.23.0 :

  - The '--base' option of 'format-patch' computed the
    patch-ids for prerequisite patches in an unstable way,
    which has been updated to compute in a way that is
    compatible with 'git patch-id

    --stable'.

  - The 'git log' command by default behaves as if the
    --mailmap option was given.

  - fixes and improvements to UI, workflow and features

git 2.22.1

  - A relative pathname given to 'git init --template=<path>
    <repo>' ought to be relative to the directory 'git init'
    gets invoked in, but it instead was made relative to the
    repository, which has been corrected.

  - 'git worktree add' used to fail when another worktree
    connected to the same repository was corrupt, which has
    been corrected.

  - 'git am -i --resolved' segfaulted after trying to see a
    commit as if it were a tree, which has been corrected.

  - 'git merge --squash' is designed to update the working
    tree and the index without creating the commit, and this
    cannot be countermanded by adding the '--commit' option;
    the command now refuses to work when both options are
    given.

  - Update to Unicode 12.1 width table.

  - 'git request-pull' learned to warn when the ref we ask
    them to pull from in the local repository and in the
    published repository are different.

  - 'git fetch' into a lazy clone forgot to fetch base
    objects that are necessary to complete delta in a thin
    packfile, which has been corrected.

  - The URL decoding code has been updated to avoid going
    past the end of the string while parsing %-<hex>-<hex>
    sequence.

  - 'git clean' silently skipped a path when it cannot
    lstat() it; now it gives a warning.

  - 'git rm' to resolve a conflicted path leaked an internal
    message 'needs merge' before actually removing the path,
    which was confusing. This has been corrected.

  - Many more bugfixes and code cleanups.

  - removal of SuSEfirewall2 service, since SuSEfirewall2
    has been replaced by firewalld.

  - partial fix for git instaweb giving 500 error
    (bsc#1112230)

git 2.22.0 

  - The filter specification '--filter=sparse:path=<path>'
    used to create a lazy/partial clone has been removed.
    Using a blob that is part of the project as sparse
    specification is still supported with the
    '--filter=sparse:oid=<blob>' option

  - 'git checkout --no-overlay' can be used to trigger a new
    mode of checking out paths out of the tree-ish, that
    allows paths that match the pathspec that are in the
    current index and working tree and are not in the
    tree-ish.

  - Four new configuration variables
    (author,committer).(name,email) have been introduced to
    override user.(name,email) in more specific cases.

  - 'git branch' learned a new subcommand '--show-current'.

  - The command line completion (in contrib/) has been
    taught to complete more subcommand parameters.

  - The completion helper code now pays attention to
    repository-local configuration (when available), which
    allows --list-cmds to honour a repository specific
    setting of completion.commands, for example.

  - The list of conflicted paths shown in the editor while
    concluding a conflicted merge was shown above the
    scissors line when the clean-up mode is set to
    'scissors', even though it was commented out just like
    the list of updated paths and other information to help
    the user explain the merge better.

  - 'git rebase' that was reimplemented in C did not set
    ORIG_HEAD correctly, which has been corrected.

  - 'git worktree add' used to do a 'find an available name
    with stat and then mkdir', which is race-prone. This has
    been fixed by using mkdir and reacting to EEXIST in a
    loop. 

  - Move to DocBook 5.x. Asciidoctor 2.x no longer supports
    the legacy DocBook 4.5 format.

  - update git-web AppArmor profile for bash and tar
    usrMerge (bsc#1132350)

git 2.21.0

  - Historically, the '-m' (mainline) option can only be
    used for 'git cherry-pick' and 'git revert' when working
    with a merge commit. This version of Git no longer warns
    or errors out when working with a single-parent commit,
    as long as the argument to the '-m' option is 1 (i.e. it
    has only one parent, and the request is to pick or
    revert relative to that first parent). Scripts that
    relied on the behaviour may get broken with this change.

  - Small fixes and features for fast-export and
    fast-import.

  - The 'http.version' configuration variable can be used
    with recent enough versions of cURL library to force the
    version of HTTP used to talk when fetching and pushing.

  - 'git push $there $src:$dst' rejects when $dst is not a
    fully qualified refname and it is not clear what the end
    user meant.

  - Update 'git multimail' from the upstream.

  - A new date format '--date=human' that morphs its output
    depending on how far the time is from the current time
    has been introduced. '--date=auto:human' can be used to
    use this new format (or any existing format) when the
    output is going to the pager or to the terminal, and
    otherwise the default format.

  - Fix worktree creation race (bsc#1114225).

  - add shadow build dependency to the -daemon subpackage.

git 2.20.1 :

  - portability fixes

  - 'git help -a' did not work well when an overly long
    alias was defined

  - no longer squelched an error message when the
    run_command API failed to run a missing command

git 2.20.0

  - 'git help -a' now gives verbose output (same as 'git
    help -av'). Those who want the old output may say 'git
    help --no-verbose -a'..

  - 'git send-email' learned to grab address-looking string
    on any trailer whose name ends with '-by'.

  - 'git format-patch' learned new '--interdiff' and
    '--range-diff' options to explain the difference between
    this version and the previous attempt in the cover
    letter (or after the three-dashes as a comment).

  - Developer builds now use -Wunused-function compilation
    option.

  - Fix a bug in which the same path could be registered
    under multiple worktree entries if the path was missing
    (for instance, was removed manually). Also, as a
    convenience, expand the number of cases in which --force
    is applicable.

  - The overly large Documentation/config.txt file have been
    split into million little pieces. This potentially
    allows each individual piece to be included into the
    manual page of the command it affects more easily.

  - Malformed or crafted data in packstream can make our
    code attempt to read or write past the allocated buffer
    and abort, instead of reporting an error, which has been
    fixed.

  - Fix for a long-standing bug that leaves the index file
    corrupt when it shrinks during a partial commit.

  - 'git merge' and 'git pull' that merges into an unborn
    branch used to completely ignore '--verify-signatures',
    which has been corrected.

  - ...and much more features and fixes

git 2.19.2 :

  - various bug fixes for multiple subcommands and
    operations

git 2.19.1 :

  - CVE-2018-17456: Specially crafted .gitmodules files may
    have allowed arbitrary code execution when the
    repository is cloned with --recurse-submodules
    (bsc#1110949)

git 2.19.0 :

  - 'git diff' compares the index and the working tree. For
    paths added with intent-to-add bit, the command shows
    the full contents of them as added, but the paths
    themselves were not marked as new files. They are now
    shown as new by default.

  - 'git apply' learned the '--intent-to-add' option so that
    an otherwise working-tree-only application of a patch
    will add new paths to the index marked with the
    'intent-to-add' bit.

  - 'git grep' learned the '--column' option that gives not
    just the line number but the column number of the hit.

  - The '-l' option in 'git branch -l' is an unfortunate
    short-hand for '--create-reflog', but many users, both
    old and new, somehow expect it to be something else,
    perhaps '--list'. This step warns when '-l' is used as a
    short-hand for '--create-reflog' and warns about the
    future repurposing of the it when it is used.

  - The userdiff pattern for .php has been updated.

  - The content-transfer-encoding of the message 'git
    send-email' sends out by default was 8bit, which can
    cause trouble when there is an overlong line to bust RFC
    5322/2822 limit. A new option 'auto' to automatically
    switch to quoted-printable when there is such a line in
    the payload has been introduced and is made the default.

  - 'git checkout' and 'git worktree add' learned to honor
    checkout.defaultRemote when auto-vivifying a local
    branch out of a remote tracking branch in a repository
    with multiple remotes that have tracking branches that
    share the same names. (merge 8d7b558bae
    ab/checkout-default-remote later to maint).

  - 'git grep' learned the '--only-matching' option.

  - 'git rebase --rebase-merges' mode now handles octopus
    merges as well.

  - Add a server-side knob to skip commits in
    exponential/fibbonacci stride in an attempt to cover
    wider swath of history with a smaller number of
    iterations, potentially accepting a larger packfile
    transfer, instead of going back one commit a time during
    common ancestor discovery during the 'git fetch'
    transaction. (merge 42cc7485a2
    jt/fetch-negotiator-skipping later to maint).

  - A new configuration variable core.usereplacerefs has
    been added, primarily to help server installations that
    want to ignore the replace mechanism altogether.

  - Teach 'git tag -s' etc. a few configuration variables
    (gpg.format that can be set to 'openpgp' or 'x509', and
    gpg.<format>.program that is used to specify what
    program to use to deal with the format) to allow x.509
    certs with CMS via 'gpgsm' to be used instead of openpgp
    via 'gnupg'.

  - Many more strings are prepared for l10n.

  - 'git p4 submit' learns to ask its own pre-submit hook if
    it should continue with submitting.

  - The test performed at the receiving end of 'git push' to
    prevent bad objects from entering repository can be
    customized via receive.fsck.* configuration variables;
    we now have gained a counterpart to do the same on the
    'git fetch' side, with fetch.fsck.* configuration
    variables.

  - 'git pull --rebase=interactive' learned 'i' as a
    short-hand for 'interactive'.

  - 'git instaweb' has been adjusted to run better with
    newer Apache on RedHat based distros.

  - 'git range-diff' is a reimplementation of 'git tbdiff'
    that lets us compare individual patches in two
    iterations of a topic.

  - The sideband code learned to optionally paint selected
    keywords at the beginning of incoming lines on the
    receiving end.

  - 'git branch --list' learned to take the default sort
    order from the 'branch.sort' configuration variable,
    just like 'git tag --list' pays attention to 'tag.sort'.

  - 'git worktree' command learned '--quiet' option to make
    it less verbose.

git 2.18.0 :

  - improvements to rename detection logic

  - When built with more recent cURL, GIT_SSL_VERSION can
    now specify 'tlsv1.3' as its value.

  - 'git mergetools' learned talking to guiffy.

  - various other workflow improvements and fixes

  - performance improvements and other developer visible
    fixes

git 2.17.1

  - Submodule 'names' come from the untrusted .gitmodules
    file, but we blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to
    create our on-disk repo paths. This means you can do bad
    things by putting '../' into the name. We now enforce
    some rules for submodule names which will cause Git to
    ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235,
    bsc#1095219)

  - It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks
    paths on NTFS into reading random piece of memory
    (CVE-2018-11233, bsc#1095218)

  - Support on the server side to reject pushes to
    repositories that attempt to create such problematic
    .gitmodules file etc. as tracked contents, to help
    hosting sites protect their customers by preventing
    malicious contents from spreading.

git 2.17.0 :

  - 'diff' family of commands learned
    '--find-object=<object-id>' option to limit the findings
    to changes that involve the named object.

  - 'git format-patch' learned to give 72-cols to diffstat,
    which is consistent with other line length limits the
    subcommand uses for its output meant for e-mails.

  - The log from 'git daemon' can be redirected with a new
    option; one relevant use case is to send the log to
    standard error (instead of syslog) when running it from
    inetd.

  - 'git rebase' learned to take '--allow-empty-message'
    option.

  - 'git am' has learned the '--quit' option, in addition to
    the existing '--abort' option; having the pair mirrors a
    few other commands like 'rebase' and 'cherry-pick'.

  - 'git worktree add' learned to run the post-checkout
    hook, just like 'git clone' runs it upon the initial
    checkout.

  - 'git tag' learned an explicit '--edit' option that
    allows the message given via '-m' and '-F' to be further
    edited.

  - 'git fetch --prune-tags' may be used as a handy
    short-hand for getting rid of stale tags that are
    locally held.

  - The new '--show-current-patch' option gives an end-user
    facing way to get the diff being applied when 'git
    rebase' (and 'git am') stops with a conflict.

  - 'git add -p' used to offer '/' (look for a matching
    hunk) as a choice, even there was only one hunk, which
    has been corrected. Also the single-key help is now
    given only for keys that are enabled (e.g. help for '/'
    won't be shown when there is only one hunk).

  - Since Git 1.7.9, 'git merge' defaulted to --no-ff (i.e.
    even when the side branch being merged is a descendant
    of the current commit, create a merge commit instead of
    fast-forwarding) when merging a tag object. This was
    appropriate default for integrators who pull signed tags
    from their downstream contributors, but caused an
    unnecessary merges when used by downstream contributors
    who habitually 'catch up' their topic branches with
    tagged releases from the upstream. Update 'git merge' to
    default to --no-ff only when merging a tag object that
    does *not* sit at its usual place in refs/tags/
    hierarchy, and allow fast-forwarding otherwise, to
    mitigate the problem.

  - 'git status' can spend a lot of cycles to compute the
    relation between the current branch and its upstream,
    which can now be disabled with '--no-ahead-behind'
    option.

  - 'git diff' and friends learned funcname patterns for Go
    language source files.

  - 'git send-email' learned '--reply-to=<address>' option.

  - Funcname pattern used for C# now recognizes 'async'
    keyword.

  - In a way similar to how 'git tag' learned to honor the
    pager setting only in the list mode, 'git config'
    learned to ignore the pager setting when it is used for
    setting values (i.e. when the purpose of the operation
    is not to 'show').
