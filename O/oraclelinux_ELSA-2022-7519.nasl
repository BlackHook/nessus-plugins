"The remote Oracle Linux 8 host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the
ELSA-2022-7519 advisory.

  - Acceptance of some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers in the HTTP/1 client in net/http before Go 1.17.12
    and Go 1.18.4 allows HTTP request smuggling if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly
    fails to reject the header as invalid. (CVE-2022-1705)

  - In Decoder.Skip in encoding/xml in Go before 1.17.12 and 1.18.x before 1.18.4, stack exhaustion and a
    panic can occur via a deeply nested XML document. (CVE-2022-28131)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Reader.Read in compress/gzip before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker
    to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via an archive containing a large number of concatenated 0-length
    compressed files. (CVE-2022-30631)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Unmarshal in encoding/xml before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to
    cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via unmarshalling an XML document into a Go struct which has a
    nested field that uses the 'any' field tag. (CVE-2022-30633)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Decoder.Decode in encoding/gob before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an
    attacker to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via a message which contains deeply nested structures.
    (CVE-2022-30635)

  - Improper exposure of client IP addresses in net/http before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 can be triggered by
    calling httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the
    X-Forwarded-For header, which causes ReverseProxy to set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For
    header. (CVE-2022-32148)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions are subject to a
    cross site request forgery vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting
    cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins).
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an authenticated user into
    inviting the attacker as a new user with high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as
    possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue. (CVE-2022-21703)

  - client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package
    in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version
    1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential
    memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an
    instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`;
    not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our
    middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`.
    client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including
    removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected
    promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method
    given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow
    a limited set of methods. (CVE-2022-21698)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in the Parse functions in go/parser before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allow an
    attacker to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via deeply nested types or declarations. (CVE-2022-1962)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Glob in io/fs before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to cause a
    panic due to stack exhaustion via a path which contains a large number of path separators.
    (CVE-2022-30630)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Glob in path/filepath before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to
    cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via a path containing a large number of path separators.
    (CVE-2022-30632)

  - The package @braintree/sanitize-url before 6.0.0 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to
    improper sanitization in sanitizeUrl function. (CVE-2021-23648)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when a data
    source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API
    token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user.
    This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack
    relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature, the
    Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana
    instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been
    patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4. (CVE-2022-21673)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions an attacker
    could serve HTML content thru the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML
    page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker could
    either compromise an existing datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own public
    service and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance. To be impacted, all of the following
    must be applicable. For the data source proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based datasource configured with Server as
    Access Mode and a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above
    datasource, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled data source must be clicked
    on by an authenticated user. For the plugin proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based app plugin configured and enabled
    with a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above app, and a
    specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled plugin must be clocked on by an authenticated
    user. For the backend plugin resource: An attacker must be able to navigate an authenticated user to a
    compromised plugin through a crafted link. Users are advised to update to a patched version. There are no
    known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-21702)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions of Grafana expose
    multiple API endpoints which do not properly handle user authorization. `/teams/:teamId` will allow an
    authenticated attacker to view unintended data by querying for the specific team ID, `/teams/:search` will
    allow an authenticated attacker to search for teams and see the total number of available teams, including
    for those teams that the user does not have access to, and `/teams/:teamId/members` when editors_can_admin
    flag is enabled, an authenticated attacker can see unintended data by querying for the specific team ID.
    Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
