    the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the
    current user.  (CVE-2019-0842)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in
    Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory
    in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary
    code in the context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0739)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Jet Database Engine improperly handles objects
    in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on a victim
    system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
    enticing a victim to open a specially crafted file. The
    update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way
    the Windows Jet Database Engine handles objects in
    memory. (CVE-2019-0846, CVE-2019-0847, CVE-2019-0851,
    CVE-2019-0877, CVE-2019-0879)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS) fails
    to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who
    successfully exploited this vulnerability could run
    arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs;
    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts
    with full user rights.  (CVE-2019-0735)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when
    Windows Task Scheduler improperly discloses credentials
    to Windows Credential Manager. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain
    information to further compromise the users system. An
    attacker could then install programs; view, change, or
    delete data; or create new accounts with full user
    rights.  (CVE-2019-0838)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when
