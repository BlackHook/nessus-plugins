"The remote SUSE Linux SLES12 host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in
the SUSE-SU-2022:2134-1 advisory.

  - ec_verify in kdc/kdc_preauth_ec.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before
    1.18.4 and 1.19.x before 1.19.2 allows remote attackers to cause a NULL pointer dereference and daemon
    crash. This occurs because a return value is not properly managed in a certain situation. (CVE-2021-36222)

  - In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
    EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the
    out parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the outlen parameter is populated with the buffer size
    required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer
    and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the out parameter. A bug
    in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to
    hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size
    required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the
    application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2
    content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to
    a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing
    application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application
    dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).
    (CVE-2021-3711)

  - Grafana is an open source data visualization platform. In affected versions unauthenticated and
    authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal
    paths: /dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key. If the snapshot public_mode configuration
    setting is set to true (vs default of false), unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with
    the lowest database key by accessing the literal path: /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Regardless of the
    snapshot public_mode setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest
    database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The
    combination of deletion and viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in
    complete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6 and 7.5.11. If for some reason
    you cannot upgrade you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to the literal paths:
    /api/snapshots/:key, /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, /dashboard/snapshot/:key, and /api/snapshots/:key.
    They have no normal function and can be disabled without side effects. (CVE-2021-39226)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions if an attacker
    is able to convince a victim to visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript content
    may be executed within the context of the victim's browser. The user visiting the malicious link must be
    unauthenticated and the link must be for a page that contains the login button in the menu bar. The url
    has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and contain the interpolation binding for AngularJS
    expressions. AngularJS uses double curly braces for interpolation binding: {{ }} ex:
    {{constructor.constructor(alert(1)')()}}. When the user follows the link and the page renders, the login
    button will contain the original link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page. The
    URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute the JavaScript expression contained
    in the URL. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you
    can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the literal string {{ in the path.
    (CVE-2021-41174)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when the fine-
    grained access control beta feature is enabled and there is more than one organization in the Grafana
    instance admins are able to access users from other organizations. Grafana 8.0 introduced a mechanism
    which allowed users with the Organization Admin role to list, add, remove, and update users' roles in
    other organizations in which they are not an admin. With fine-grained access control enabled, organization
    admins can list, add, remove and update users' roles in another organization, where they do not have
    organization admin role. All installations between v8.0 and v8.2.3 that have fine-grained access control
    beta enabled and more than one organization should be upgraded as soon as possible. If you cannot upgrade,
    you should turn off the fine-grained access control using a feature flag. (CVE-2021-41244)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana versions 8.0.0-beta1 through
    8.3.0 (except for patched versions) iss vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing access to local files.
    The vulnerable URL path is: `<grafana_host_url>/public/plugins//`, where is the plugin ID for any
    installed plugin. At no time has Grafana Cloud been vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to patched
    versions 8.0.7, 8.1.8, 8.2.7, or 8.3.1. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more information about
    vulnerable URL paths, mitigation, and the disclosure timeline. (CVE-2021-43798)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana prior to versions 8.3.2 and
    7.5.12 contains a directory traversal vulnerability for fully lowercase or fully uppercase .md files. The
    vulnerability is limited in scope, and only allows access to files with the extension .md to authenticated
    users only. Grafana Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability. Users should upgrade to
    patched versions 8.3.2 or 7.5.12. For users who cannot upgrade, running a reverse proxy in front of
    Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. The proxy will have to
    also be able to handle url encoded paths. Alternatively, for fully lowercase or fully uppercase .md files,
    users can block /api/plugins/.*/markdown/.* without losing any functionality beyond inlined plugin help
    text. (CVE-2021-43813)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana prior to versions 8.3.2 and
    7.5.12 has a directory traversal for arbitrary .csv files. It only affects instances that have the
    developer testing tool called TestData DB data source enabled and configured. The vulnerability is limited
    in scope, and only allows access to files with the extension .csv to authenticated users only. Grafana
    Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability. Versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 contain a patch for
    this issue. There is a workaround available for users who cannot upgrade. Running a reverse proxy in front
    of Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. The proxy will have to
    also be able to handle url encoded paths. (CVE-2021-43815)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions when a data
    source has the Forward OAuth Identity feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API
    token (and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the most recently logged-in user.
    This can allow API token holders to retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack
    relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the Forward OAuth Identity feature, the
    Grafana instance having a data source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana
    instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable API keys. This issue has been
    patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4. (CVE-2022-21673)

  - client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in Prometheus, and the promhttp package
    in client_golang provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version
    1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality, and potential
    memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an
    instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`;
    not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to our
    middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away requests with unknown `method`.
    client_golang version 1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including
    removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected
    promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method
    given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow
    a limited set of methods. (CVE-2022-21698)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions an attacker
    could serve HTML content thru the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML
    page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker could
    either compromise an existing datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own public
    service and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance. To be impacted, all of the following
    must be applicable. For the data source proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based datasource configured with Server as
    Access Mode and a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above
    datasource, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled data source must be clicked
    on by an authenticated user. For the plugin proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based app plugin configured and enabled
    with a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above app, and a
    specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled plugin must be clocked on by an authenticated
    user. For the backend plugin resource: An attacker must be able to navigate an authenticated user to a
    compromised plugin through a crafted link. Users are advised to update to a patched version. There are no
    known workarounds for this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-21702)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions are subject to a
    cross site request forgery vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting
    cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins).
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an authenticated user into
    inviting the attacker as a new user with high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as
    possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue. (CVE-2022-21703)

  - Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Affected versions of Grafana expose
    multiple API endpoints which do not properly handle user authorization. `/teams/:teamId` will allow an
    authenticated attacker to view unintended data by querying for the specific team ID, `/teams/:search` will
    allow an authenticated attacker to search for teams and see the total number of available teams, including
    for those teams that the user does not have access to, and `/teams/:teamId/members` when editors_can_admin
    flag is enabled, an authenticated attacker can see unintended data by querying for the specific team ID.
    Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
