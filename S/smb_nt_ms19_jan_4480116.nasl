"The remote Windows host is missing security update 4480116.
It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could obtain information to further compromise the users
    system.  (CVE-2019-0536, CVE-2019-0549, CVE-2019-0554)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in
    memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could
    corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could
    execute arbitrary code in the context of the current
    user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the
    current user.  (CVE-2019-0539, CVE-2019-0567,
    CVE-2019-0568)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when
    Windows Subsystem for Linux improperly handles objects
    in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could obtain information to further
    compromise the users system. A attacker could exploit
    this vulnerability by running a specially crafted
    application. The update addresses the vulnerability by
    correcting how Windows Subsystem for Linux handles
    objects in memory. (CVE-2019-0553)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in .NET
    Framework and .NET Core which allows bypassing Cross-
    origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could retrieve content, that is normally restricted,
    from a web application. The security update addresses
    the vulnerability by enforcing CORS configuration to
    prevent its bypass. (CVE-2019-0545)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when
    Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly
    validate input from an authenticated user on a guest
    operating system.  (CVE-2019-0550, CVE-2019-0551)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Jet Database Engine improperly handles objects
    in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on a victim
    system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
    enticing a victim to open a specially crafted file. The
    update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way
    the Windows Jet Database Engine handles objects in
    memory. (CVE-2019-0538, CVE-2019-0575, CVE-2019-0576,
    CVE-2019-0577, CVE-2019-0578, CVE-2019-0579,
    CVE-2019-0580, CVE-2019-0581, CVE-2019-0582,
    CVE-2019-0583, CVE-2019-0584)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when
    Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory.
    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way
    that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
    the context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0565)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the
    Microsoft XmlDocument class that could allow an attacker
    to escape from the AppContainer sandbox in the browser.
    An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and break
    out of the Edge AppContainer sandbox. The vulnerability
    by itself does not allow arbitrary code to run. However,
    this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one
    or more vulnerabilities (for example a remote code
    execution vulnerability and another elevation of
    privilege vulnerability) to take advantage of the
    elevated privileges when running. The security update
    addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the
    Microsoft XmlDocument class enforces sandboxing.
    (CVE-2019-0555)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when
    Windows improperly handles authentication requests. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could run processes in an elevated context. An attacker
    could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially
    crafted application on the victim system. The update
    addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way
    Windows handles authentication requests. (CVE-2019-0543)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Runtime improperly handles objects in memory. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could run arbitrary code in an elevated context. An
    attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a
    specially crafted application on the victim system. The
    update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way
    the Windows Runtime handles objects in memory.
    (CVE-2019-0570)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the MSHTML engine inproperly validates input. An
    attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of
    the current user.  (CVE-2019-0541)

  - An elevation of privilege exists in Windows COM Desktop
    Broker. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated
    privileges.  (CVE-2019-0552)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in
    Microsoft Edge Browser Broker COM object. An attacker
    who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use
    the Browser Broker COM object to elevate privileges on
    an affected system. This vulnerability by itself does
    not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could
    allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it
    in combination with another vulnerability (such as a
    remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation
    of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of
    leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution
    is attempted. (CVE-2019-0566)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could obtain information to further compromise the users
    system. An authenticated attacker could exploit this
    vulnerability by running a specially crafted
    application. The update addresses the vulnerability by
    correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in
    memory. (CVE-2019-0569)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Data Sharing Service improperly handles file
    operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could run processes in an elevated
    context. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
    running a specially crafted application on the victim
    system. The update addresses the vulnerability by
    correcting the way the Windows Data Sharing Service
    handles file operations. (CVE-2019-0571, CVE-2019-0572,
    CVE-2019-0573, CVE-2019-0574)");
