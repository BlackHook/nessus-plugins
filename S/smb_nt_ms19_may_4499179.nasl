"The remote Windows host is missing security update 4499179.
It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - A new subclass of speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities,
    known as Microarchitectural Data Sampling, exist in Windows.
    An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities 
    may be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries. 
    In shared resource environments (such as exists in some cloud 
    services configurations), these vulnerabilities could allow 
    one virtual machine to improperly access information from 
    another. In non-browsing scenarios on standalone systems, an 
    attacker would need prior access to the system or an ability 
    to run a specially crafted application on the target system 
    to leverage these vulnerabilities.
    (CVE-2019-11091, CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when
    urlmon.dll improperly handles certain Mark of the Web
    queries. The vulnerability allows Internet Explorer to
    bypass Mark of the Web warnings or restrictions for
    files downloaded or created in a specific way.
    (CVE-2019-0995)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that Microsoft browsers access objects in memory. The
    vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could
    allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
    context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0940)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Jet Database Engine improperly handles objects
    in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on a victim
    system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
    enticing a victim to open a specially crafted file. The
    update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way
    the Windows Jet Database Engine handles objects in
    memory. (CVE-2019-0889, CVE-2019-0890, CVE-2019-0891,
    CVE-2019-0893, CVE-2019-0894, CVE-2019-0895,
    CVE-2019-0896, CVE-2019-0897, CVE-2019-0898,
    CVE-2019-0899, CVE-2019-0900, CVE-2019-0901,
    CVE-2019-0902)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Kernel improperly handles key enumeration. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could gain elevated privileges on a targeted system. A
    locally authenticated attacker could exploit this
    vulnerability by running a specially crafted
    application. The security update addresses the
    vulnerability by helping to ensure that the Windows
    Kernel properly handles key enumeration. (CVE-2019-0881)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles
    objects in the memory. An attacker who successfully
    exploited this vulnerability could take control of the
    affected system. An attacker could then install
    programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new
    accounts with full user rights.  (CVE-2019-0903)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when
    Windows Hyper-V on a host operating system fails to
    properly validate input from an authenticated user on a
    guest operating system.  (CVE-2019-0886)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the
    Unified Write Filter (UWF) feature for Windows 10 when
    it improperly restricts access to the registry. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could make changes to the registry keys protected by UWF
    without having administrator privileges.
    (CVE-2019-0942)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the Chakra scripting engine handles objects in
    memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could
    corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could
    execute arbitrary code in the context of the current
    user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the
    current user.  (CVE-2019-0912, CVE-2019-0913,
    CVE-2019-0914, CVE-2019-0915, CVE-2019-0916,
    CVE-2019-0917, CVE-2019-0922, CVE-2019-0923,
    CVE-2019-0924, CVE-2019-0925, CVE-2019-0927,
    CVE-2019-0933)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in
    Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) which could
    allow an attacker to bypass WDAC enforcement. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could circumvent Windows PowerShell Constrained Language
    Mode on the machine.  (CVE-2019-0733)

  - An spoofing vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer
    improperly handles URLs. An attacker who successfully
    exploited this vulnerability could trick a user by
    redirecting the user to a specially crafted website. The
    specially crafted website could either spoof content or
    serve as a pivot to chain an attack with other
    vulnerabilities in web services.  (CVE-2019-0921)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the
    Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector or the Visual Studio
    Standard Collector allows file deletion in arbitrary
    locations.  (CVE-2019-0727)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in
    Microsoft Windows when a man-in-the-middle attacker is
    able to successfully decode and replace authentication
    request using Kerberos, allowing an attacker to be
    validated as an Administrator. The update addresses this
    vulnerability by changing how these requests are
    validated. (CVE-2019-0734)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when
    Microsoft Windows OLE fails to properly validate user
    input. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to
    execute malicious code.  (CVE-2019-0885)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    the scripting engine handles objects in memory in
    Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability could corrupt
    memory in such a way that an attacker could execute
    arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could gain the same user rights as the current user.
    (CVE-2019-0884, CVE-2019-0911, CVE-2019-0918)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the
    way Windows Error Reporting (WER) handles files. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker
    could then install programs; view, change, or delete
    data; or create new accounts with administrator
    privileges.  (CVE-2019-0863)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when
    Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory.
    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could obtain information to further compromise the users
    system.  (CVE-2019-0930)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when .NET
    Framework and .NET Core improperly process RegEx
    strings. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a
    .NET application. A remote unauthenticated attacker
    could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially
    crafted requests to a .NET Framework (or .NET core)
    application. The update addresses the vulnerability by
    correcting how .NET Framework and .NET Core applications
    handle RegEx string processing. (CVE-2019-0820)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in
    Microsoft Windows when Windows fails to properly handle
    certain symbolic links. An attacker who successfully
    exploited this vulnerability could potentially set
    certain items to run at a higher level and thereby
    elevate permissions.  (CVE-2019-0936)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when .NET
    Framework improperly handles objects in heap memory. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could cause a denial of service against a .NET
    application.  (CVE-2019-0864)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows GDI component improperly discloses the contents
    of its memory. An attacker who successfully exploited
    the vulnerability could obtain information to further
    compromise the users system. There are multiple ways an
    attacker could exploit the vulnerability, such as by
    convincing a user to open a specially crafted document,
    or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage.
    The security update addresses the vulnerability by
    correcting how the Windows GDI component handles objects
    in memory. (CVE-2019-0758, CVE-2019-0882, CVE-2019-0961)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in
    Microsoft Edge that could allow an attacker to escape
    from the AppContainer sandbox in the browser. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could gain elevated privileges and break out of the Edge
    AppContainer sandbox. The vulnerability by itself does
    not allow arbitrary code to run. However, this
    vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or
    more vulnerabilities (for example a remote code
    execution vulnerability and another elevation of
    privilege vulnerability) to take advantage of the
    elevated privileges when running. The security update
    addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft
    Edge handles sandboxing. (CVE-2019-0938)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the
    Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) when
    ndis.sys fails to check the length of a buffer prior to
    copying memory to it.  (CVE-2019-0707)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when .NET
    Framework or .NET Core improperly handle web requests.
    An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a
    .NET Framework or .NET Core web application. The
    vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without
    authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could
    exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted
    requests to the .NET Framework or .NET Core application.
    The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
    .NET Framework or .NET Core web applications handles web
    requests. (CVE-2019-0980, CVE-2019-0981)");
