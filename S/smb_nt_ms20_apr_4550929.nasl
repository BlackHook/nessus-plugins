"The remote Windows host is missing security update 4550929.
It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a
    Windows scheduled task improperly handles file
    redirections. An attacker who successfully exploited
    this vulnerability could delete a targeted file they
    would not have permissions to.  (CVE-2020-0936)

    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
    create new accounts with full user rights. There are
    multiple ways an attacker could exploit the
    vulnerability, such as by convincing a user to open a
    specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to
    visit a malicious webpage. The security update addresses
    the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media
    Foundation handles objects in memory. (CVE-2020-0948,
    CVE-2020-0949, CVE-2020-0950)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in
    Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt
    memory in such a way that an attacker could execute
    arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could gain the same user rights as the current user.
    (CVE-2020-0968)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Jet Database Engine improperly handles objects
    in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on a victim
    system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by

    exploited the vulnerability could execute code remotely.
    For systems running Windows 10, an attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute
    code in an AppContainer sandbox context with limited
    privileges and capabilities. An attacker could then
    install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
    create new accounts with full user rights. There are
    multiple ways an attacker could exploit the
    vulnerability, such as convincing a user to open a
    specially crafted document or viewing it in the Windows
