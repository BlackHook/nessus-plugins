    way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code
    in the context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user. If the current
    user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
    attacker could take control of an affected system. An
    attacker could then install programs; view, change, or
    delete data; or create new accounts with full user
    rights.  (CVE-2020-1568)
