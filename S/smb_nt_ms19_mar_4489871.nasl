"The remote Windows host is missing security update 4489871.
It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows kernel fails to properly initialize a memory
    address. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could obtain information to further
    compromise the users system.  (CVE-2019-0782)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when
    Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory.
    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way
    that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
    the context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0779)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that Microsoft browsers access objects in memory. The
    vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that could
    allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
    context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0780)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    the scripting engine handles objects in memory in
    Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability could corrupt
    memory in such a way that an attacker could execute
    arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could gain the same user rights as the current user.
    (CVE-2019-0609)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An
    attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
    could obtain information to further compromise the users
    system.  (CVE-2019-0702, CVE-2019-0755, CVE-2019-0775)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    way that the Windows SMB Server handles certain
    requests. An authenticated attacker who successfully
    exploited this vulnerability could craft a special
    packet, which could lead to information disclosure from
    the server.  (CVE-2019-0703, CVE-2019-0704,
    CVE-2019-0821)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Print Spooler does not properly handle objects
    in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could use the information to further
    exploit the victim system.  (CVE-2019-0759)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when
    Microsoft Edge does not properly enforce cross-domain
    policies, which could allow an attacker to access
    information from one domain and inject it into another
    domain.  (CVE-2019-0678)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the
    Windows Jet Database Engine improperly handles objects
    in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on a victim
    system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
    enticing a victim to open a specially crafted file. The
    update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way
    the Windows Jet Database Engine handles objects in
    memory. (CVE-2019-0617)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when
    Click2Play protection in Microsoft Edge improperly
    handles flash objects. By itself, this bypass
    vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution.
    However, an attacker could use the bypass vulnerability
    in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a
    remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary
    code on a target system.  (CVE-2019-0612)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft
    Hyper-V Network Switch on a host server fails to
    properly validate input from a privileged user on a
    guest operating system. An attacker who successfully
    exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server
    to crash.  (CVE-2019-0690)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in
    Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly
    handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully
    exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in
    kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs;
    view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts
    with full user rights.  (CVE-2019-0797)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when Windows
    improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause a
    target system to stop responding.  (CVE-2019-0754)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in
    Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could corrupt memory
    in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary
    code in the context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0769,
    CVE-2019-0770, CVE-2019-0771, CVE-2019-0773)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft
    Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly validate
    input from a privileged user on a guest operating
    system.  (CVE-2019-0695)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in
    Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt
    memory in such a way that an attacker could execute
    arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could gain the same user rights as the current user.
    (CVE-2019-0680, CVE-2019-0783)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way
    that the ActiveX Data objects (ADO) handles objects in
    memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a
    way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the
    context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0784)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    win32k component improperly provides kernel information.
    An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could obtain information to further compromise the users
    system.  (CVE-2019-0776)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in
    Windows AppX Deployment Server that allows file creation
    in arbitrary locations.  (CVE-2019-0766)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the
    Windows kernel fails to properly handle objects in
    memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
    vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
    An attacker could then install programs; view, change,
    or delete data; or create new accounts with full user
    rights.  (CVE-2019-0696)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows GDI component improperly discloses the contents
    of its memory. An attacker who successfully exploited
    the vulnerability could obtain information to further
    compromise the users system. There are multiple ways an
    attacker could exploit the vulnerability, such as by
    convincing a user to open a specially crafted document,
    or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage.
    The security update addresses the vulnerability by
    correcting how the Windows GDI component handles objects
    in memory. (CVE-2019-0614, CVE-2019-0774)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the
    Windows kernel improperly initializes objects in memory.
    (CVE-2019-0767)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when
    Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.
    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way
    that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the
    context of the current user. An attacker who
    successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2019-0763)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when
    Internet Explorer fails to validate the correct Security
    Zone of requests for specific URLs. This could allow an
    attacker to cause a user to access a URL in a less
    restricted Internet Security Zone than intended.
    (CVE-2019-0761)

  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to an
    integer overflow in Windows Subsystem for Linux. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability
    could execute code with elevated permissions.
    (CVE-2019-0682)

  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the
    Microsoft XML Core Services MSXML parser processes user
    input. An attacker who successfully exploited the
