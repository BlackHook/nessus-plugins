"The remote Linux kernel is affected by a series of information
disclosure vulnerabilities.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"According to the remote Linux kernel, this system is vulnerable to
the following information disclosure vulnerabilities:

  - MSBDS leaks Store Buffer Entries which can be
    speculatively forwarded to a dependent load
    (store-to-load forwarding) as an optimization. The
    forward can also happen to a faulting or assisting load
    operation for a different memory address, which can
    cause an issue under certain conditions. Store buffers
    are partitioned between Hyper-Threads so cross thread
    forwarding is not possible. But if a thread enters or
    exits a sleep state the store buffer is repartitioned
    which can expose data from one thread to the other.
    (MSBDS/Fallout) (CVE-2018-12126)

  - MLDPS leaks Load Port Data. Load ports are used to
    perform load operations from memory or I/O. The received
    data is then forwarded to the register file or a
    subsequent operation. In some implementations the Load
    Port can contain stale data from a previous operation
    which can be forwarded to faulting or assisting loads
    under certain conditions, which again can cause an issue
    eventually. Load ports are shared between Hyper-Threads
    so cross thread leakage is possible. (MLPDS/RIDL)
    (CVE-2018-12127)

    MFBDS leaks Fill Buffer Entries. Fill buffers are used
    internally to manage L1 miss situations and to hold data
    which is returned or sent in response to a memory or I/O
    operation. Fill buffers can forward data to a load
    operation and also write data to the cache. When the
    fill buffer is deallocated it can retain the stale data
    of the preceding operations which can then be forwarded
    to a faulting or assisting load operation, which can
    cause an issue under certain conditions. Fill buffers
    are shared between Hyper-Threads so cross thread leakage
    is possible. (MFBDS/RIDL/ZombieLoad) (CVE-2018-12130)

  - MDSUM is a special case of MSBDS, MFBDS and MLPDS. An
    uncacheable load from memory that takes a fault or
    assist can leave data in a microarchitectural structure
    that may later be observed using one of the same methods
    used by MSBDS, MFBDS or MLPDS. (MDSUM/RIDL)
    (CVE-2019-11091)

To address these issues, update the kernel packages on your Linux
system, disable Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) or otherwise
configure it to a non-vulnerable state, and apply microcode fixes to
your hardware. Consult your Linux distribution and processor hardware
