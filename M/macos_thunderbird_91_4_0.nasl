"The version of Thunderbird installed on the remote macOS or Mac OS X host is prior to 91.4.0. It is, therefore, affected
by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2021-54 advisory.

  - Under certain circumstances, asynchronous functions could have caused a navigation to fail but expose the
    target URL. (CVE-2021-43536)

  - An incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers allowed an attacker to corrupt memory
    leading to a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2021-43537)

  - By misusing a race in our notification code, an attacker could have forcefully hidden the notification for
    pages that had received full screen and pointer lock access, which could have been used for spoofing
    attacks. (CVE-2021-43538)

  - Failure to correctly record the location of live pointers across wasm instance calls resulted in a GC
    occurring within the call not tracing those live pointers. This could have led to a use-after-free causing
    a potentially exploitable crash. (CVE-2021-43539)

  - When invoking protocol handlers for external protocols, a supplied parameter URL containing spaces was not
    properly escaped. (CVE-2021-43541)

  - Using XMLHttpRequest, an attacker could have identified installed applications by probing error messages
    for loading external protocols. (CVE-2021-43542)

  - Documents loaded with the CSP sandbox directive could have escaped the sandbox's script restriction by
    embedding additional content. (CVE-2021-43543)

  - Using the Location API in a loop could have caused severe application hangs and crashes. (CVE-2021-43545)

  - It was possible to recreate previous cursor spoofing attacks against users with a zoomed native cursor.
    (CVE-2021-43546)

  - Thunderbird unexpectedly enabled JavaScript in the composition area. The JavaScript execution context was
    limited to this area and did not receive chrome-level privileges, but could be used as a stepping stone to
    further an attack with other vulnerabilities. (CVE-2021-43528)

Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.");
