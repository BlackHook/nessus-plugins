    error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-147802478References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2020-0466)

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP. This flaw allows an attacker who can send a malicious packet to be processed
    by OpenLDAP's slapd server, to trigger an assertion failure. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to system availability. (CVE-2020-25709)

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious
    packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2020-25710)

  - http.client in Python 3.x before 3.5.10, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, 3.7.x before 3.7.9, and 3.8.x before 3.8.5
    allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR
    and LF control characters in the first argument of HTTPConnection.request. (CVE-2020-26116)

  - urllib3 before 1.25.9 allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as
    demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest(). NOTE: this
    is similar to CVE-2020-26116. (CVE-2020-26137)

  - In unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible use after free bug due to a race condition. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3003.3. A user who has control of the source, and
    source_hash URLs can gain full file system access as root on a salt minion. (CVE-2021-21996)

  - Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to
    remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
    input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used
    unsafely. (CVE-2021-3177)

  - A flaw double-free memory corruption in the Linux kernel HCI device initialization subsystem was found in
    the way user attach malicious HCI TTY Bluetooth device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the
    system. This flaw affects all the Linux kernel versions starting from 3.13. (CVE-2021-3564)

  - A use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way
    user calls ioct HCIUNBLOCKADDR or other way triggers race condition of the call hci_unregister_dev()
    together with one of the calls hci_sock_blacklist_add(), hci_sock_blacklist_del(), hci_get_conn_info(),
    hci_get_auth_info(). A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their
    privileges on the system. This flaw affects the Linux kernel versions prior to 5.13-rc5. (CVE-2021-3573)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size
    increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS
    filesystem otherwise not accessible to them. (CVE-2021-4155)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, a left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function in
    xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior (e.g., allocating too few bytes, or only freeing memory).
    (CVE-2021-45960)

  - In doProlog in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, an integer overflow exists for
    m_groupSize. (CVE-2021-46143)

  - A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the
    way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or
    escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-0330)

  - A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups
    v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly.
    (CVE-2022-0492)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the
    attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content
    to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing
    filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in
    crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write
    arbitrary files on the system. (CVE-2022-1271)

  - A race condition was found the Linux kernel in perf_event_open() which can be exploited by an unprivileged
    user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit primitives such as kernel address
    information leak, arbitrary execution, etc. (CVE-2022-1729)

  - Incomplete cleanup of multi-core shared buffers for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated
    user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. (CVE-2022-21123)

  - Incomplete cleanup of microarchitectural fill buffers on some Intel(R) Processors may allow an
    authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. (CVE-2022-21125)

  - Incomplete cleanup in specific special register write operations for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an
    authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. (CVE-2022-21166)

  - nextScaffoldPart in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
    (CVE-2022-22826)

  - storeAtts in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22827)

  - Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.4 has a signed integer overflow in XML_GetBuffer, for configurations with
    a nonzero XML_CONTEXT_BYTES. (CVE-2022-23852)

  - In Cyrus SASL 2.1.17 through 2.1.27 before 2.1.28, plugins/sql.c does not escape the password for a SQL
    INSERT or UPDATE statement. (CVE-2022-24407)

  - xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of encoding, such as checks
    for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain context. (CVE-2022-25235)

  - xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 allows attackers to insert namespace-separator characters
    into namespace URIs. (CVE-2022-25236)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd. This issue occurs due to the on_stream_io() function
    and dns_stream_complete() function in 'resolved-dns-stream.c' not incrementing the reference counting for
    the DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions and callbacks called can dereference the DNSStream
    object, causing the use-after-free when the reference is still used later. (CVE-2022-2526)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, there is an integer overflow in storeRawNames. (CVE-2022-25315)

  - If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the WebSocket connection closing when
    running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75 or Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20, it is possible that the
    application will continue to use the socket after it has been closed. The error handling triggered in this
    case could cause the a pooled object to be placed in the pool twice. This could result in subsequent
    connections using the same object concurrently which could result in data being returned to the wrong use
    and/or other errors. (CVE-2022-25762)

  - An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary
    files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to
    the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync
    server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory
    and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file). (CVE-2022-29154)

  - The documentation of Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M14, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.20, 9.0.13 to 9.0.62 and
    8.5.38 to 8.5.78 for the EncryptInterceptor incorrectly stated it enabled Tomcat clustering to run over an
    untrusted network. This was not correct. While the EncryptInterceptor does provide confidentiality and
    integrity protection, it does not protect against all risks associated with running over any untrusted
    network, particularly DoS risks. (CVE-2022-29885)

  - VMware Tools (12.0.0, 11.x.y and 10.x.y) contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability. A malicious
    actor with local non-administrative access to the Guest OS can escalate privileges as a root user in the
    virtual machine. (CVE-2022-31676)

  - The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious
    XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler
    and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. The Apache Xalan Java project is dormant and in the process of being
    retired. No future releases of Apache Xalan Java to address this issue are expected. Note: Java runtimes
    (such as OpenJDK) include repackaged copies of Xalan. (CVE-2022-34169)

  - In Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M16, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.22, 9.0.30 to 9.0.64 and 8.5.50 to 8.5.81 the
    Form authentication example in the examples web application displayed user provided data without
    filtering, exposing a XSS vulnerability. (CVE-2022-34305)

  - kernel: failing usercopy allows for use-after-free exploitation (CVE-2022-22942)
