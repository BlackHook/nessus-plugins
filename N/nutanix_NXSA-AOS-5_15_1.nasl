"The Nutanix AOS host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities .");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"The version of AOS installed on the remote host is prior to 5.15.1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-5.15.1 advisory.

  - The Requests package before 2.20.0 for Python sends an HTTP Authorization header to an http URI upon
    receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover
    credentials by sniffing the network. (CVE-2018-18074)

  - urllib3 before version 1.23 does not remove the Authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin
    redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the
    Authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext. (CVE-2018-20060)

  - TSX Asynchronous Abort condition on some CPUs utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated
    user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access. (CVE-2019-11135)

  - In the urllib3 library through 1.24.1 for Python, CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls the
    request parameter. (CVE-2019-11236)

  - The urllib3 library before 1.24.2 for Python mishandles certain cases where the desired set of CA
    certificates is different from the OS store of CA certificates, which results in SSL connections
    succeeding in situations where a verification failure is the correct outcome. This is related to use of
    the ssl_context, ca_certs, or ca_certs_dir argument. (CVE-2019-11324)

  - The Linux kernel before 5.1-rc5 allows page->_refcount reference count overflow, with resultant use-after-
    free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c,
    include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c, mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c. It can
    occur with FUSE requests. (CVE-2019-11487)

  - An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0. When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the
    library can either allocate very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to
    process the image. (CVE-2019-16865)

  - rtl_p2p_noa_ie in drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/ps.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.6 lacks a
    certain upper-bound check, leading to a buffer overflow. (CVE-2019-17666)

  - A flaw was found in the fix for CVE-2019-11135, in the Linux upstream kernel versions before 5.5 where,
    the way Intel CPUs handle speculative execution of instructions when a TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) error
    occurs. When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by the TAA flaw (TAA_NO=0), but is not affected by
    the MDS issue (MDS_NO=1), the guest was to clear the affected buffers by using a VERW instruction
    mechanism. But when the MDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, the guests did not use the VERW mechanism
    to clear the affected buffers. This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that
    host has 'TSX' enabled. Confidentiality of data is the highest threat associated with this vulnerability.
    (CVE-2019-19338)

  - An issue was discovered in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ through 66.1. An integer
    overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, exists in the UnicodeString::doAppend() function in
    common/unistr.cpp. (CVE-2020-10531)

  - libImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has a PCX P mode buffer overflow. (CVE-2020-5312)
