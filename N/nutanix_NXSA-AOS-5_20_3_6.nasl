  - In various methods of hid-multitouch.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds
    check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-162844689References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2020-0465)

  - In do_epoll_ctl and ep_loop_check_proc of eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free due to a logic
    error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-147802478References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2020-0466)

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP. This flaw allows an attacker who can send a malicious packet to be processed
    by OpenLDAP's slapd server, to trigger an assertion failure. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to system availability. (CVE-2020-25709)

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious
    packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2020-25710)

  - In unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible use after free bug due to a race condition. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3003.3. A user who has control of the source, and
    source_hash URLs can gain full file system access as root on a salt minion. (CVE-2021-21996)

  - A flaw double-free memory corruption in the Linux kernel HCI device initialization subsystem was found in
    the way user attach malicious HCI TTY Bluetooth device. A local user could use this flaw to crash the
    system. This flaw affects all the Linux kernel versions starting from 3.13. (CVE-2021-3564)

  - A use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way
    user calls ioct HCIUNBLOCKADDR or other way triggers race condition of the call hci_unregister_dev()
    together with one of the calls hci_sock_blacklist_add(), hci_sock_blacklist_del(), hci_get_conn_info(),
    hci_get_auth_info(). A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their
    privileges on the system. This flaw affects the Linux kernel versions prior to 5.13-rc5. (CVE-2021-3573)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size
    increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS
    filesystem otherwise not accessible to them. (CVE-2021-4155)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, a left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function in
    xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior (e.g., allocating too few bytes, or only freeing memory).
    (CVE-2021-45960)

  - In doProlog in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, an integer overflow exists for
    m_groupSize. (CVE-2021-46143)

  - A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the
    way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or
    escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-0330)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier fails to close inbound connection when errors are encountered
    discarding the request body, exposing the server to HTTP Request Smuggling (CVE-2022-22720)

  - addBinding in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22822)

  - build_model in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22823)

  - defineAttribute in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
    (CVE-2022-22824)

  - lookup in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22825)

  - nextScaffoldPart in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
    (CVE-2022-22826)

  - storeAtts in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22827)

  - Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.4 has a signed integer overflow in XML_GetBuffer, for configurations with
    a nonzero XML_CONTEXT_BYTES. (CVE-2022-23852)

  - In Cyrus SASL 2.1.17 through 2.1.27 before 2.1.28, plugins/sql.c does not escape the password for a SQL
    INSERT or UPDATE statement. (CVE-2022-24407)

  - xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of encoding, such as checks
    for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain context. (CVE-2022-25235)

  - xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 allows attackers to insert namespace-separator characters
    into namespace URIs. (CVE-2022-25236)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, there is an integer overflow in storeRawNames. (CVE-2022-25315)

  - kernel: failing usercopy allows for use-after-free exploitation (CVE-2022-22942)
