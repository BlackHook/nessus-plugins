"The version of AOS installed on the remote host is prior to 5.20.3.5. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-5.20.3.5 advisory.

  - Included in Log4j 1.2 is a SocketServer class that is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data
    which can be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget when
    listening to untrusted network traffic for log data. This affects Log4j versions up to 1.2 up to 1.2.17.
    (CVE-2019-17571)

  - A flaw memory leak in the Linux kernel performance monitoring subsystem was found in the way if using
    PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_FILTER. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of
    service. (CVE-2020-25704)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - When using Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M4, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.34, 8.5.0 to 8.5.54 and 7.0.0 to
    7.0.103 if a) an attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the server; and b) the
    server is configured to use the PersistenceManager with a FileStore; and c) the PersistenceManager is
    configured with sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter=null (the default unless a SecurityManager is used)
    or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized; and d) the attacker
    knows the relative file path from the storage location used by FileStore to the file the attacker has
    control over; then, using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to trigger remote code
    execution via deserialization of the file under their control. Note that all of conditions a) to d) must
    be true for the attack to succeed. (CVE-2020-9484)

  - Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP appender. This could allow an
    SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent
    through that appender. Fixed in Apache Log4j 2.12.3 and 2.13.1 (CVE-2020-9488)

  - In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 a specially crafted SessionHeader sent by an origin server
    could cause a heap overflow (CVE-2021-26691)

  - Malformed requests may cause the server to dereference a NULL pointer. This issue affects Apache HTTP
    Server 2.4.48 and earlier. (CVE-2021-34798)

  - ap_escape_quotes() may write beyond the end of a buffer when given malicious input. No included modules
    pass untrusted data to these functions, but third-party / external modules may. This issue affects Apache
    HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier. (CVE-2021-39275)

  - A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is
    a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according
    predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly
    and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting
    environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully
    executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights
    on the target machine. (CVE-2021-4034)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel FireDTV media card driver, where the user
    calls the CA_SEND_MSG ioctl. This flaw allows a local user of the host machine to crash the system or
    escalate privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - A carefully crafted request body can cause a buffer overflow in the mod_lua multipart parser
    (r:parsebody() called from Lua scripts). The Apache httpd team is not aware of an exploit for the
    vulnerability though it might be possible to craft one. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and
    earlier. (CVE-2021-44790)

  - Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 (excluding 2.12.3 and 2.3.1) did not protect from
    uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread
    Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed
    in Log4j 2.17.0, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. (CVE-2021-45105)

  - AIDE before 0.17.4 allows local users to obtain root privileges via crafted file metadata (such as XFS
    extended attributes or tmpfs ACLs), because of a heap-based buffer overflow. (CVE-2021-45417)

  - Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE
    (component: Serialization). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 7u321, 8u311,

    (CVE-2022-21349)

  - Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE
    (component: ImageIO). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 7u321, 8u311, 11.0.13,

    (CVE-2022-21360, CVE-2022-21365)

  - The fix for bug CVE-2020-9484 introduced a time of check, time of use vulnerability into Apache Tomcat
    10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M8, 10.0.0-M5 to 10.0.14, 9.0.35 to 9.0.56 and 8.5.55 to 8.5.73 that allowed a local
    attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the user that the Tomcat process is using. This issue
    is only exploitable when Tomcat is configured to persist sessions using the FileStore. (CVE-2022-23181)

  - JMSSink in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker
    has write access to the Log4j configuration or if the configuration references an LDAP service the
    attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing
    JMSSink to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to
    CVE-2021-4104. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, which
    is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2
    as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions. (CVE-2022-23302)

  - By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as a configuration parameter where the
    values to be inserted are converters from PatternLayout. The message converter, %m, is likely to always be
    included. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by entering crafted strings into input fields or
    headers of an application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to be executed. Note this issue
    only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default.
    Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced with proper support for parameterized
    SQL queries and further customization over the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of
    life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the
    previous versions. (CVE-2022-23305)

  - CVE-2020-9493 identified a deserialization issue that was present in Apache Chainsaw. Prior to Chainsaw
    V2.0 Chainsaw was a component of Apache Log4j 1.2.x where the same issue exists. (CVE-2022-23307)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
