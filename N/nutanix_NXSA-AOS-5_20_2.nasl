"The version of AOS installed on the remote host is prior to 5.20.2. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-5.20.2 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2.6. On NUMA systems, the Linux fair scheduler has a
    use-after-free in show_numa_stats() because NUMA fault statistics are inappropriately freed, aka
    CID-16d51a590a8c. (CVE-2019-20934)

  - In the Linux kernel before 5.6.1, drivers/media/usb/gspca/xirlink_cit.c (aka the Xirlink camera USB
    driver) mishandles invalid descriptors, aka CID-a246b4d54770. (CVE-2020-11668)

  - Integer overflow in the firmware for some Intel(R) Graphics Drivers for Windows * before version
    26.20.100.7212 and before Linux kernel version 5.5 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable an
    escalation of privilege via local access. (CVE-2020-12362)

  - Improper input validation in some Intel(R) Graphics Drivers for Windows* before version 26.20.100.7212 and
    before Linux kernel version 5.5 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable a denial of service via
    local access. (CVE-2020-12363)

  - Null pointer reference in some Intel(R) Graphics Drivers for Windows* before version 26.20.100.7212 and
    before version Linux kernel version 5.5 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable a denial of
    service via local access. (CVE-2020-12364)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-
    of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre
    mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-f232326f6966. This affects
    pointer types that do not define a ptr_limit. (CVE-2020-27170)

  - A flaw was found in the way RTAS handled memory accesses in userspace to kernel communication. On a locked
    down (usually due to Secure Boot) guest system running on top of PowerVM or KVM hypervisors (pseries
    platform) a root like local user could use this flaw to further increase their privileges to that of a
    running kernel. (CVE-2020-27777)

  - There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through 5.5.2 in the n_tty_receive_buf_common
    function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c. (CVE-2020-8648)

  - A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c.
    This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name
    space (CVE-2021-22555)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component:
    Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u301, 8u291, 11.0.11, 16.0.1; Oracle
    GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.2 and 21.1.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated
    attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise
    Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful
    attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Oracle
    GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
    typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
    and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
    security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
    only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-2341)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component:
    Library). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u301, 8u291, 11.0.11, 16.0.1; Oracle GraalVM
    Enterprise Edition: 20.3.2 and 21.1.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
    with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition.
    Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of
    this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Oracle
    GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
    typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load
    and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
    security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
    only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2021-2369)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component:
    Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u291, 11.0.11, 16.0.1; Oracle GraalVM
    Enterprise Edition: 20.3.2 and 21.1.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
    with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition.
    Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of
    this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This
    vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
    internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
    deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
    administrator). (CVE-2021-2388)

  - In BIND 9.8.5 -> 9.8.8, 9.9.3 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and
    9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.11
    of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named receives a malformed IXFR
    triggering the flaw described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion the next
    time the transferred secondary zone is refreshed. (CVE-2021-25214)

  - In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases
    in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no
    longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from
    those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering
    the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected
    (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler
    flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced
    the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when
    reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to
    the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd
    server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
    the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in
    lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in
    the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit
    architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not
    occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be
    improperly deleted. (CVE-2021-25217)

  - An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has
    an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow
    could potentially lead to memory corruption. (CVE-2021-27219)

  - BPF JIT compilers in the Linux kernel through 5.11.12 have incorrect computation of branch displacements,
    allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the kernel context. This affects
    arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c. (CVE-2021-29154)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.11. The netfilter subsystem allows attackers to
    cause a denial of service (panic) because net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h
    lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value, aka CID-175e476b8cdf.
    (CVE-2021-29650)

  - net/bluetooth/hci_request.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.2 has a race condition for removal of the HCI
    controller. (CVE-2021-32399)

  - The Linux kernel before 5.11.14 has a use-after-free in cipso_v4_genopt in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c because
    the CIPSO and CALIPSO refcounting for the DOI definitions is mishandled, aka CID-ad5d07f4a9cd. This leads
    to writing an arbitrary value. (CVE-2021-33033)

  - In the Linux kernel before 5.12.4, net/bluetooth/hci_event.c has a use-after-free when destroying an
    hci_chan, aka CID-5c4c8c954409. This leads to writing an arbitrary value. (CVE-2021-33034)

  - Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.66 did not correctly parse the HTTP
    transfer-encoding request header in some circumstances leading to the possibility to request smuggling
    when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: - Tomcat incorrectly ignored the transfer encoding header if
    the client declared it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; - Tomcat honoured the identify encoding;
    and - Tomcat did not ensure that, if present, the chunked encoding was the final encoding.
    (CVE-2021-33037)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.11. PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling, allowing local users to execute code in the kernel, aka CID-34b1a1ce1458.
    (CVE-2021-3347)

  - fs/seq_file.c in the Linux kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4 does not properly restrict seq buffer
    allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an Out-of-bounds Write, and escalation to root by an
    unprivileged user, aka CID-8cae8cd89f05. (CVE-2021-33909)

  - A flaw was found in the Routing decision classifier in the Linux kernel's Traffic Control networking
    subsystem in the way it handled changing of classification filters, leading to a use-after-free condition.
    This flaw allows unprivileged local users to escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat
    from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3715)
