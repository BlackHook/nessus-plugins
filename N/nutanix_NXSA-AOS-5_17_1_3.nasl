"The version of AOS installed on the remote host is prior to 5.17.1.3. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-5.17.1.3 advisory.

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. A double free may be caused by the function
    allocate_trace_buffer in the file kernel/trace/trace.c. (CVE-2017-18595)

  - In the Linux kernel 5.4.0-rc2, there is a use-after-free (read) in the __blk_add_trace function in
    kernel/trace/blktrace.c (which is used to fill out a blk_io_trace structure and place it in a per-cpu sub-
    buffer). (CVE-2019-19768)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem in versions before 5.7.
    This flaw occurs while importing the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into
    the SELinux extensible bitmap via the' ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine. While processing the CIPSO
    restricted bitmap tag in the 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm' routine, it sets the security attribute to indicate
    that the category bitmap is present, even if it has not been allocated. This issue leads to a NULL pointer
    dereference issue while importing the same category bitmap into SELinux. This flaw allows a remote network
    user to crash the system kernel, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2020-10711)

  - ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows an off-path attacker to block unauthenticated
    synchronization via a server mode packet with a spoofed source IP address, because transmissions are
    rescheduled even when a packet lacks a valid origin timestamp. (CVE-2020-11868)

  - An issue was discovered in dbus >= 1.3.0 before 1.12.18. The DBusServer in libdbus, as used in dbus-
    daemon, leaks file descriptors when a message exceeds the per-message file descriptor limit. A local
    attacker with access to the D-Bus system bus or another system service's private AF_UNIX socket could use
    this to make the system service reach its file descriptor limit, denying service to subsequent D-Bus
    clients. (CVE-2020-12049)

  - The VFIO PCI driver in the Linux kernel through 5.6.13 mishandles attempts to access disabled memory
    space. (CVE-2020-12888)

  - ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (daemon exit or system time change) by predicting transmit timestamps for use in spoofed packets. The
    victim must be relying on unauthenticated IPv4 time sources. There must be an off-path attacker who can
    query time from the victim's ntpd instance. (CVE-2020-13817)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u251. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as
    unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: Applies to client
    and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the
    specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as
    through a web service. (CVE-2020-14556)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u261, 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u251.
    Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: Applies to client and server
    deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and
    sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component
    without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web
    service. (CVE-2020-14577)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u261 and 8u251; Java SE Embedded: 8u251. Difficult to exploit
    vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise
    Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to
    cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: Applies to client and
    server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the
    specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as
    through a web service. (CVE-2020-14578, CVE-2020-14579)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u261, 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u251.
    Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple
    protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a
    person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may
    significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover
    of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
    running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code
    (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
    does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code
    installed by an administrator). (CVE-2020-14583)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: 2D). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u261, 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u251. Easily
    exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other
    than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly
    impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation,
    deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note:
    This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
    internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
    deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
    administrator). (CVE-2020-14593)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: JAXP). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u261, 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u251. Easily
    exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This
    vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using
    Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service.
    (CVE-2020-14621)

  - When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to
    9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one
    request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of user A's request.
    (CVE-2021-25122)

  - The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to
    9.0.41, 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 or 7.0.0. to 7.0.107 with a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be
    used, the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494. Note that both the previously published
    prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and the previously published mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to
    this issue. (CVE-2021-25329)
