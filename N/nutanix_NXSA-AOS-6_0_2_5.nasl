"The version of AOS installed on the remote host is prior to 6.0.2.5. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-6.0.2.5 advisory.

  - xpointer.c in libxml2 before 2.9.5 (as used in Apple iOS before 10, OS X before 10.12, tvOS before 10, and
    watchOS before 3, and other products) does not forbid namespace nodes in XPointer ranges, which allows
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and memory
    corruption) via a crafted XML document. (CVE-2016-4658)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process
    ClearFuncs class does not properly validate method calls. This allows a remote user to access some methods
    without authentication. These methods can be used to retrieve user tokens from the salt master and/or run
    arbitrary commands on salt minions. (CVE-2020-11651)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process
    ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow
    arbitrary directory access to authenticated users. (CVE-2020-11652)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10. drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c has a use-after-
    free because the ctx is reached via the ctx_list in some ucma_migrate_id situations where ucma_close is
    called, aka CID-f5449e74802c. (CVE-2020-36385)

  - A flaw was found in RPM's signature check functionality when reading a package file. This flaw allows an
    attacker who can convince a victim to install a seemingly verifiable package, whose signature header was
    modified, to cause RPM database corruption and execute code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability. (CVE-2021-20271)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument
    in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the
    platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the
    output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
    OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
    OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out
    of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should
    upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x). (CVE-2021-23840)

  - The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based
    on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly
    handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is
    maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a
    potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by
    OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on
    certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are
    affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x
    and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving
    public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should
    upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2x). (CVE-2021-23841)

  - A vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to authenticate using variations of
    a valid user name and/or to bypass some of the protection provided by the LockOut Realm. This issue
    affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.5; 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.45; 8.5.0 to 8.5.65. (CVE-2021-30640)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the virt_ext field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the
    L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire
    system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. (CVE-2021-3656)

  - arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_rtas.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.5 on the powerpc platform allows KVM guest
    OS users to cause host OS memory corruption via rtas_args.nargs, aka CID-f62f3c20647e. (CVE-2021-37576)

  - The Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.18.5 and 1.19.x before 1.19.3 has
    a NULL pointer dereference in kdc/do_tgs_req.c via a FAST inner body that lacks a server field.
    (CVE-2021-37750)

  - A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the
    remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier. (CVE-2021-40438)

  - sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows
    privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for
    AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group
    memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.
    (CVE-2021-41617)

  - The fix for bug 63362 present in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M5, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.11, 9.0.40 to
    9.0.53 and 8.5.60 to 8.5.71 introduced a memory leak. The object introduced to collect metrics for HTTP
    upgrade connections was not released for WebSocket connections once the connection was closed. This
    created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to a denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError.
    (CVE-2021-42340)

  - ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm in the Unicode Specification through
    14.0. It permits the visual reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to craft
    source code that renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and
    interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode such
    that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium
    offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of
    international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the
    Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior when text includes left-to-
    right and right-to-left characters, the visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order.
    Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements of bidirectional text can
    further obfuscate the logical order of tokens. Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such
    that the ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will be processed by a
    compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in its
    document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also
    provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode
    Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the
    BIDI specification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways that can mitigate misleading
    visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.
    (CVE-2021-42574)

  - NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a heap overflow
    when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures
    encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely to be impacted. Applications using NSS for
    certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how
    they configure NSS. *Note: This vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and
    PDF viewers that use NSS for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and
    Evince are believed to be impacted. This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS < 3.68.1.
    (CVE-2021-43527)

  - It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-
    default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data
    when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for
    example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input
    data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some
    environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix
    this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.
