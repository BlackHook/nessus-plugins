"The version of AOS installed on the remote host is prior to 6.6. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities
as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-6.6 advisory.

  - Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to 4.3.15 and older unsupported
    versions, allow applications to expose STOMP over WebSocket endpoints with a simple, in-memory STOMP
    broker through the spring-messaging module. A malicious user (or attacker) can craft a message to the
    broker that can lead to a remote code execution attack. (CVE-2018-1270)

  - zlib before 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many
    distant matches. (CVE-2018-25032)

  - http.client in Python 3.x before 3.5.10, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, 3.7.x before 3.7.9, and 3.8.x before 3.8.5
    allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR
    and LF control characters in the first argument of HTTPConnection.request. (CVE-2020-26116)

  - urllib3 before 1.25.9 allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as
    demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest(). NOTE: this
    is similar to CVE-2020-26116. (CVE-2020-26137)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3003.3. A user who has control of the source, and
    source_hash URLs can gain full file system access as root on a salt minion. (CVE-2021-21996)

  - Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to
    remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted
    input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used
    unsafely. (CVE-2021-3177)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, a left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function in
    xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior (e.g., allocating too few bytes, or only freeing memory).
    (CVE-2021-45960)

  - In doProlog in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, an integer overflow exists for
    m_groupSize. (CVE-2021-46143)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the
    attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content
    to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing
    filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in
    crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write
    arbitrary files on the system. (CVE-2022-1271)

  - Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE
    (component: JAXP). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 7u331, 8u321, 11.0.14, 17.0.2,

    security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through
    a web service which supplies data to the APIs. (CVE-2022-21541)

  - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier fails to close inbound connection when errors are encountered
    discarding the request body, exposing the server to HTTP Request Smuggling (CVE-2022-22720)

  - addBinding in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22822)

  - build_model in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22823)

  - defineAttribute in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
    (CVE-2022-22824)

  - lookup in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22825)

  - nextScaffoldPart in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
    (CVE-2022-22826)

  - storeAtts in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22827)

  - Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.4 has a signed integer overflow in XML_GetBuffer, for configurations with
    a nonzero XML_CONTEXT_BYTES. (CVE-2022-23852)

  - xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of encoding, such as checks
    for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain context. (CVE-2022-25235)

  - xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 allows attackers to insert namespace-separator characters
    into namespace URIs. (CVE-2022-25236)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd. This issue occurs due to the on_stream_io() function
    and dns_stream_complete() function in 'resolved-dns-stream.c' not incrementing the reference counting for
    the DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions and callbacks called can dereference the DNSStream
    object, causing the use-after-free when the reference is still used later. (CVE-2022-2526)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, there is an integer overflow in storeRawNames. (CVE-2022-25315)

  - If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the WebSocket connection closing when
    running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75 or Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20, it is possible that the
    application will continue to use the socket after it has been closed. The error handling triggered in this
    case could cause the a pooled object to be placed in the pool twice. This could result in subsequent
    connections using the same object concurrently which could result in data being returned to the wrong use
    and/or other errors. (CVE-2022-25762)

  - An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary
    files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to
    the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync
    server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory
    and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file). (CVE-2022-29154)

  - The documentation of Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M14, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.20, 9.0.13 to 9.0.62 and
    8.5.38 to 8.5.78 for the EncryptInterceptor incorrectly stated it enabled Tomcat clustering to run over an
    untrusted network. This was not correct. While the EncryptInterceptor does provide confidentiality and
    integrity protection, it does not protect against all risks associated with running over any untrusted
    network, particularly DoS risks. (CVE-2022-29885)

  - VMware Tools (12.0.0, 11.x.y and 10.x.y) contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability. A malicious
    actor with local non-administrative access to the Guest OS can escalate privileges as a root user in the
    virtual machine. (CVE-2022-31676)

  - The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious
    XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler
    and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. The Apache Xalan Java project is dormant and in the process of being
    retired. No future releases of Apache Xalan Java to address this issue are expected. Note: Java runtimes
    (such as OpenJDK) include repackaged copies of Xalan. (CVE-2022-34169)

  - In Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M16, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.22, 9.0.30 to 9.0.64 and 8.5.50 to 8.5.81 the
    Form authentication example in the examples web application displayed user provided data without
    filtering, exposing a XSS vulnerability. (CVE-2022-34305)

  - Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing properties to be dynamically evaluated and
    expanded. The standard format for interpolation is ${prefix:name}, where prefix is used to locate an
    instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup that performs the interpolation. Starting with
    version 1.5 and continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that
    could result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers. These lookups are: - script -
    execute expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) - dns - resolve dns records -
    url - load values from urls, including from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults
    in the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact with remote
    servers if untrusted configuration values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons
    Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default. (CVE-2022-42889)
