"The version of AHV installed on the remote host is prior to 20201105.2175. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AHV-20201105.2175 advisory.

  - In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases
    in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no
    longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from
    those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering
    the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected
    (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler
    flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced
    the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when
    reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to
    the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd
    server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
    the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in
    lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in
    the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit
    architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not
    occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be
    improperly deleted. (CVE-2021-25217)

  - An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has
    an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow
    could potentially lead to memory corruption. (CVE-2021-27219)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.");
