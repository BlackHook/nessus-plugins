"The version of AHV installed on the remote host is prior to 20201105.2286. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AHV-20201105.2286 advisory.

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP. This flaw allows an attacker who can send a malicious packet to be processed
    by OpenLDAP's slapd server, to trigger an assertion failure. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to system availability. (CVE-2020-25709)

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious
    packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2020-25710)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3003.3. A user who has control of the source, and
    source_hash URLs can gain full file system access as root on a salt minion. (CVE-2021-21996)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, a left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function in
    xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior (e.g., allocating too few bytes, or only freeing memory).
    (CVE-2021-45960)

  - In doProlog in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, an integer overflow exists for
    m_groupSize. (CVE-2021-46143)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - addBinding in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22822)

  - build_model in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22823)

  - defineAttribute in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
    (CVE-2022-22824)

  - lookup in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22825)

  - nextScaffoldPart in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow.
    (CVE-2022-22826)

  - storeAtts in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3 has an integer overflow. (CVE-2022-22827)

  - Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.4 has a signed integer overflow in XML_GetBuffer, for configurations with
    a nonzero XML_CONTEXT_BYTES. (CVE-2022-23852)

  - In Cyrus SASL 2.1.17 through 2.1.27 before 2.1.28, plugins/sql.c does not escape the password for a SQL
    INSERT or UPDATE statement. (CVE-2022-24407)

  - xmltok_impl.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 lacks certain validation of encoding, such as checks
    for whether a UTF-8 character is valid in a certain context. (CVE-2022-25235)

  - xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5 allows attackers to insert namespace-separator characters
    into namespace URIs. (CVE-2022-25236)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, there is an integer overflow in storeRawNames. (CVE-2022-25315)
