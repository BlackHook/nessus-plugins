"The remote machine is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.");
  script_set_attribute(attribute:"description", value:
"The remote NewStart CGSL host, running version MAIN 4.05, has thunderbird packages installed that are affected by
multiple vulnerabilities:

  - Incorrect convexity calculations in Skia in Google
    Chrome prior to 72.0.3626.81 allowed a remote attacker
    to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted
    HTML page. (CVE-2019-5785)

  - The type inference system allows the compilation of
    functions that can cause type confusions between
    arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey
    just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor
    function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR).
    This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing
    of objects during an exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR <
    60.6, and Firefox < 66. (CVE-2019-9791)

  - A flaw during verification of certain S/MIME signatures
    causes emails to be shown in Thunderbird as having a
    valid digital signature, even if the shown message
    contents aren't covered by the signature. The flaw
    allows an attacker to reuse a valid S/MIME signature to
    craft an email message with arbitrary content. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.5.1.
    (CVE-2018-18509)

  - Incorrect alias information in IonMonkey JIT compiler
    for Array.prototype.slice method may lead to missing
    bounds check and a buffer overflow. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 66.0.1, Firefox ESR < 60.6.1, and
    Thunderbird < 60.6.1. (CVE-2019-9810)

  - Incorrect handling of __proto__ mutations may lead to
    type confusion in IonMonkey JIT code and can be
    leveraged for arbitrary memory read and write. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 66.0.1, Firefox ESR <
    60.6.1, and Thunderbird < 60.6.1. (CVE-2019-9813)

  - When proxy auto-detection is enabled, if a web server
    serves a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file or if a PAC
    file is loaded locally, this PAC file can specify that
    requests to the localhost are to be sent through the
    proxy to another server. This behavior is disallowed by
    default when a proxy is manually configured, but when
    enabled could allow for attacks on services and tools
    that bind to the localhost for networked behavior if
    they are accessed through browsing. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 65. (CVE-2018-18506)

  - Mozilla developers and community members reported memory
    safety bugs present in Firefox 65, Firefox ESR 60.5, and
    Thunderbird 60.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
    memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort
    that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6,
    Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66. (CVE-2019-9788)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw
    pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using
    JavaScript and the element is then removed while still
    in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox
    ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66. (CVE-2019-9790)

  - The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an
    internal JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT magic value to the running
    script during a bailout. This magic value can then be
    used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which
    results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR <
    60.6, and Firefox < 66. (CVE-2019-9792)

  - A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds
    checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if
    Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This
    vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an
    arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the
    range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect
    range in circumstances where users have explicitly
    disabled Spectre mitigations. *Note: Spectre mitigations
    are currently enabled for all users by default
    settings.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.
    (CVE-2019-9793)

  - A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey
    just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by
    malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox <
    66. (CVE-2019-9795)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL
    animation controller incorrectly registers with the
    refresh driver twice when only a single registration is
    expected. When a registration is later freed with the
    removal of the animation controller element, the refresh
    driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the
    driver's observer array. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox <
    66. (CVE-2019-9796)

  - png_image_free in png.c in libpng 1.6.36 has a use-
    after-free because png_image_free_function is called
    under png_safe_execute. (CVE-2019-7317)

  - If a crafted hyperlink is dragged and dropped to the
    bookmark bar or sidebar and the resulting bookmark is
    subsequently dragged and dropped into the web content
    area, an arbitrary query of a user's browser history can
    be run and transmitted to the content page via drop
    event data. This allows for the theft of browser history
    by a malicious site. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 60.7, Firefox < 67, and Firefox ESR <
    60.7. (CVE-2019-11698)

  - Lack of correct bounds checking in Skia in Google Chrome
    prior to 73.0.3683.75 allowed a remote attacker to
    perform an out of bounds memory read via a crafted HTML
    page. (CVE-2019-5798)

  - Cross-origin images can be read from a canvas element in
    violation of the same-origin policy using the
    transferFromImageBitmap method. *Note: This only affects
    Firefox 65. Previous versions are unaffected.*. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 65.0.1. (CVE-2018-18511)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when working
    with XMLHttpRequest (XHR) in an event loop, causing the
    XHR main thread to be called after it has been freed.
    This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.7, Firefox < 67,
    and Firefox ESR < 60.7. (CVE-2019-11691)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when listeners
    are removed from the event listener manager while still
    in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.7, Firefox <
    67, and Firefox ESR < 60.7. (CVE-2019-11692)

  - The bufferdata function in WebGL is vulnerable to a
    buffer overflow with specific graphics drivers on Linux.
    This could result in malicious content freezing a tab or
    triggering a potentially exploitable crash. *Note: this
    issue only occurs on Linux. Other operating systems are
    unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    60.7, Firefox < 67, and Firefox ESR < 60.7.
    (CVE-2019-11693)

  - Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the
    same-origin policy by exporting an image after using
    createImageBitmap to read the image and then rendering
    the resulting bitmap image within a canvas element. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 66. (CVE-2019-9797)

  - Mozilla developers and community members reported memory
    safety bugs present in Firefox 66, Firefox ESR 60.6, and
    Thunderbird 60.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
    memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort
    that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.7,
    Firefox < 67, and Firefox ESR < 60.7. (CVE-2019-9800)

  - Images from a different domain can be read using a
    canvas object in some circumstances. This could be used
    to steal image data from a different site in violation
    of same-origin policy. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 60.7, Firefox < 67, and Firefox ESR <
    60.7. (CVE-2019-9817)

  - A vulnerability where a JavaScript compartment mismatch
    can occur while working with the fetch API, resulting in
    a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 60.7, Firefox < 67, and Firefox
    ESR < 60.7. (CVE-2019-9819)

  - A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in the chrome
    event handler when it is freed while still in use. This
    results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.7, Firefox < 67,
    and Firefox ESR < 60.7. (CVE-2019-9820)

  - An integer overflow in path handling lead to a use after
    free in Skia in Google Chrome prior to 71.0.3578.80
    allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap
    corruption via a crafted HTML page. (CVE-2018-18356)
