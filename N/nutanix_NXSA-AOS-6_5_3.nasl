"The version of AOS installed on the remote host is prior to 6.5.3. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the NXSA-AOS-6.5.3 advisory.

  - mm/rmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.19.7 has a use-after-free related to leaf anon_vma double reuse.
    (CVE-2022-42703)

  - A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SYSCTL subsystem in how a user changes certain
    kernel parameters and variables. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their
    privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-4378)

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
    incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently
    interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
    checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may
    allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate
    chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these
    inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
    uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented
    their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

  - In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-
    provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append
    arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected
    versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a
    -- argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.
    (CVE-2023-22809)

  - BIND 9.11.0 -> 9.11.36 9.12.0 -> 9.16.26 9.17.0 -> 9.18.0 BIND Supported Preview Editions: 9.11.4-S1 ->
    9.11.36-S1 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.26-S1 Versions of BIND 9 earlier than those shown - back to 9.1.0, including
    Supported Preview Editions - are also believed to be affected but have not been tested as they are EOL.
    The cache could become poisoned with incorrect records leading to queries being made to the wrong servers,
    which might also result in false information being returned to clients. (CVE-2021-25220)

  - By flooding the target resolver with queries exploiting this flaw an attacker can significantly impair the
    resolver's performance, effectively denying legitimate clients access to the DNS resolution service.
    (CVE-2022-2795)

  - Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE
    (component: Serialization). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u351, 8u351-perf;
    Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8 and 21.3.4. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows
    unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle
    GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update,
    insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.
    Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web
    Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from
    the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
    deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
    administrator). (CVE-2023-21830)

  - Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE
    (component: Sound). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u351, 8u351-perf, 11.0.17,
    17.0.5, 19.0.1; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8, 21.3.4 and 22.3.0. Difficult to exploit
    vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise
    Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition
    accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
    sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g.,
    code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not
    apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed
    by an administrator). (CVE-2023-21843)

  - LFENCE/JMP (mitigation V2-2) may not sufficiently mitigate CVE-2017-5715 on some AMD CPUs.
    (CVE-2021-26401)

  - A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet
    Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes.
    (CVE-2022-2964)

  - zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a
    large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some
    common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g.,
    see the nodejs/node reference). (CVE-2022-37434)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap
    buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
    malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But
    there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the
    octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence
    of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote
    exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing
    modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,
    `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
    directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module
    `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present
    on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be
    specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important
    modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

  - net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able to create
    user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to
    a use-after-free. (CVE-2022-32250)

  - An attacker could construct a PKCS 12 cert bundle in such a way that could allow for arbitrary memory
    writes via PKCS 12 Safe Bag attributes being mishandled.  (CVE-2023-0767)

  - grub2: Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets (CVE-2022-28733)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.");
