  - xpointer.c in libxml2 before 2.9.5 (as used in Apple iOS before 10, OS X before 10.12, tvOS before 10, and
    watchOS before 3, and other products) does not forbid namespace nodes in XPointer ranges, which allows
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and memory
    corruption) via a crafted XML document. (CVE-2016-4658)

  - Included in Log4j 1.2 is a SocketServer class that is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data
    which can be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget when
    listening to untrusted network traffic for log data. This affects Log4j versions up to 1.2 up to 1.2.17.
    (CVE-2019-17571)

  - In various methods of hid-multitouch.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds
    check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-162844689References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2020-0465)

  - In do_epoll_ctl and ep_loop_check_proc of eventpoll.c, there is a possible use after free due to a logic
    error. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.
    User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-147802478References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2020-0466)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process
    ClearFuncs class does not properly validate method calls. This allows a remote user to access some methods
    without authentication. These methods can be used to retrieve user tokens from the salt master and/or run
    arbitrary commands on salt minions. (CVE-2020-11651)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process
    ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow
    arbitrary directory access to authenticated users. (CVE-2020-11652)

  - A flaw memory leak in the Linux kernel performance monitoring subsystem was found in the way if using
    PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_FILTER. A local user could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of
    service. (CVE-2020-25704)

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP. This flaw allows an attacker who can send a malicious packet to be processed
    by OpenLDAP's slapd server, to trigger an assertion failure. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to system availability. (CVE-2020-25709)

  - A flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious
    packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to system availability. (CVE-2020-25710)

  - An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.10.6, aka
    CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations, causing a system
    crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as
    CVE-2021-28950. (CVE-2020-36322)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10. drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c has a use-after-
    free because the ctx is reached via the ctx_list in some ucma_migrate_id situations where ucma_close is
    called, aka CID-f5449e74802c. (CVE-2020-36385)

  - When using Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M4, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.34, 8.5.0 to 8.5.54 and 7.0.0 to
    7.0.103 if a) an attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the server; and b) the
    server is configured to use the PersistenceManager with a FileStore; and c) the PersistenceManager is
    configured with sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter=null (the default unless a SecurityManager is used)
    or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized; and d) the attacker
    knows the relative file path from the storage location used by FileStore to the file the attacker has
    control over; then, using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to trigger remote code
    execution via deserialization of the file under their control. Note that all of conditions a) to d) must
    be true for the attack to succeed. (CVE-2020-9484)

  - Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j SMTP appender. This could allow an
    SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent
    through that appender. Fixed in Apache Log4j 2.12.3 and 2.13.1 (CVE-2020-9488)

  - In unix_scm_to_skb of af_unix.c, there is a possible use after free bug due to a race condition. This
    could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-196926917References:
    Upstream kernel (CVE-2021-0920)

  - A flaw was found in RPM's signature check functionality when reading a package file. This flaw allows an
    attacker who can convince a victim to install a seemingly verifiable package, whose signature header was
    modified, to cause RPM database corruption and execute code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability. (CVE-2021-20271)

  - An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 3003.3. A user who has control of the source, and
    source_hash URLs can gain full file system access as root on a salt minion. (CVE-2021-21996)

  - An issue was discovered in Linux: KVM through Improper handling of VM_IO|VM_PFNMAP vmas in KVM can bypass
    RO checks and can lead to pages being freed while still accessible by the VMM and guest. This allows users
    with the ability to start and control a VM to read/write random pages of memory and can result in local
    privilege escalation. (CVE-2021-22543)

  - Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument
    in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the
    platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the
    output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash.
    OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
    OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out
    of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should
    upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x). (CVE-2021-23840)

  - The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based
    on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly
    handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is
    maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a
    potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by
    OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on
    certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are
    affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x
    and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving
    public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should
    upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2x). (CVE-2021-23841)

  - In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 a specially crafted SessionHeader sent by an origin server
    could cause a heap overflow (CVE-2021-26691)

  - A vulnerability in the JNDI Realm of Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to authenticate using variations of
    a valid user name and/or to bypass some of the protection provided by the LockOut Realm. This issue
    affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.5; 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.45; 8.5.0 to 8.5.65. (CVE-2021-30640)

  - Malformed requests may cause the server to dereference a NULL pointer. This issue affects Apache HTTP
    Server 2.4.48 and earlier. (CVE-2021-34798)

    system. This flaw affects all the Linux kernel versions starting from 3.13. (CVE-2021-3564)

  - A use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way
    user calls ioct HCIUNBLOCKADDR or other way triggers race condition of the call hci_unregister_dev()
    together with one of the calls hci_sock_blacklist_add(), hci_sock_blacklist_del(), hci_get_conn_info(),
    hci_get_auth_info(). A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their
    privileges on the system. This flaw affects the Linux kernel versions prior to 5.13-rc5. (CVE-2021-3573)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the int_ctl field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest
    would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak
    of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7. (CVE-2021-3653)

  - A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when
    processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested
    guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the virt_ext field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to
    disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the
    L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire
    system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. (CVE-2021-3656)

  - A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem in the way user calls connect to
    the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This flaw allows a user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-3752)

  - arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_rtas.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.5 on the powerpc platform allows KVM guest
    OS users to cause host OS memory corruption via rtas_args.nargs, aka CID-f62f3c20647e. (CVE-2021-37576)

  - ap_escape_quotes() may write beyond the end of a buffer when given malicious input. No included modules
    pass untrusted data to these functions, but third-party / external modules may. This issue affects Apache
    HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier. (CVE-2021-39275)

  - A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is
    a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according
    predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly
    and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting
    environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully
    executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights
    on the target machine. (CVE-2021-4034)

  - A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the
    remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier. (CVE-2021-40438)

  - JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write
    access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can provide TopicBindingName and
    TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result
    in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2
    when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of
    life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the
    previous versions. (CVE-2021-4104)

  - A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for size
    increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to leak data on the XFS
    filesystem otherwise not accessible to them. (CVE-2021-4155)

  - sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows
    privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for
    AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group
    memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.
    (CVE-2021-41617)

  - The fix for bug 63362 present in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M5, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.11, 9.0.40 to
    9.0.53 and 8.5.60 to 8.5.71 introduced a memory leak. The object introduced to collect metrics for HTTP
    upgrade connections was not released for WebSocket connections once the connection was closed. This
    created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to a denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError.
    (CVE-2021-42340)

  - ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm in the Unicode Specification through
    14.0. It permits the visual reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to craft
    source code that renders different logic than the logical ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and
    interpreters. Adversaries can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting Unicode such
    that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium
    offers the following alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of
    international text that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode Standard and the
    Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior when text includes left-to-
    right and right-to-left characters, the visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order.
    Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the requirements of bidirectional text can
    further obfuscate the logical order of tokens. Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source code such
    that the ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers does not match what will be processed by a
    compiler/interpreter/etc. The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in its
    document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also
    provides guidance on mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode
    Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31, Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the
    BIDI specification allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways that can mitigate misleading
    visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.
    (CVE-2021-42574)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel FireDTV media card driver, where the user
    calls the CA_SEND_MSG ioctl. This flaw allows a local user of the host machine to crash the system or
    escalate privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
    integrity, as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-42739)

  - NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a heap overflow
    when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures
    encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely to be impacted. Applications using NSS for
    certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how
    they configure NSS. *Note: This vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and
    PDF viewers that use NSS for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and
    Evince are believed to be impacted. This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS < 3.68.1.
    (CVE-2021-43527)

  - Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI
    features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled
    LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters
    can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From
    log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3,
    and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to
    log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.
    (CVE-2021-44228)

  - A carefully crafted request body can cause a buffer overflow in the mod_lua multipart parser
    (r:parsebody() called from Lua scripts). The Apache httpd team is not aware of an exploit for the
    vulnerability though it might be possible to craft one. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and
    earlier. (CVE-2021-44790)

  - Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are
    vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack when a configuration uses a JDBC Appender with a JNDI
    LDAP data source URI when an attacker has control of the target LDAP server. This issue is fixed by
    limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.
    (CVE-2021-44832)

  - It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-
    default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data
    when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for
    example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input
    data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some
    environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix
    this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.
    (CVE-2021-45046)

  - Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 (excluding 2.12.3 and 2.3.1) did not protect from
    uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread
    Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed
    in Log4j 2.17.0, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1. (CVE-2021-45105)

  - AIDE before 0.17.4 allows local users to obtain root privileges via crafted file metadata (such as XFS
    extended attributes or tmpfs ACLs), because of a heap-based buffer overflow. (CVE-2021-45417)

  - In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, a left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function in
    xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior (e.g., allocating too few bytes, or only freeing memory).
    (CVE-2021-45960)

  - In doProlog in xmlparse.c in Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, an integer overflow exists for
    m_groupSize. (CVE-2021-46143)

  - A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver functionality in the
    way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or
    escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-0330)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)
