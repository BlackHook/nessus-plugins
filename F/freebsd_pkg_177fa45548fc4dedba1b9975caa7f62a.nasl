"Jon Siwek of Corelight reports :

The following Denial of Service vulnerabilities are addressed :

- Integer type mismatches in BinPAC-generated parser code and Bro
analyzer code may allow for crafted packet data to cause unintentional
code paths in the analysis logic to be taken due to unsafe integer
conversions causing the parser and analysis logic to each expect
different fields to have been parsed. One such example, reported by
Maksim Shudrak, causes the Kerberos analyzer to dereference a null
pointer. CVE-2019-12175 was assigned for this issue.

- The Kerberos parser allows for several fields to be left
uninitialized, but they were not marked with an &optional attribute
and several usages lacked existence checks. Crafted packet data could
potentially cause an attempt to access such uninitialized fields,
generate a runtime error/exception, and leak memory. Existence checks
and &optional attributes have been added to the relevent Kerberos
fields.

- BinPAC-generated protocol parsers commonly contain fields whose
length is derived from other packet input, and for those that allow
for incremental parsing, BinPAC did not impose a limit on how large
such a field could grow, allowing for remotely-controlled packet data
to cause growth of BinPAC's flowbuffer bounded only by the numeric
limit of an unsigned 64-bit integer, leading to memory exhaustion.
There is now a generalized limit for how large flowbuffers are allowed
to grow, tunable by setting 'BinPAC::flowbuffer_capacity_max'."
