"The version of FreeBSD installed on the remote host is prior to tested version. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the 0c52abde-717b-11ed-98ca-40b034429ecf advisory.

  - There is a flaw in RPM's signature functionality. OpenPGP subkeys are associated with a primary key via a
    binding signature. RPM does not check the binding signature of subkeys prior to importing them. If an
    attacker is able to add or socially engineer another party to add a malicious subkey to a legitimate
    public key, RPM could wrongly trust a malicious signature. The greatest impact of this flaw is to data
    integrity. To exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince an
    administrator to install an untrusted RPM or public key. It is strongly recommended to only use RPMs and
    public keys from trusted sources. (CVE-2021-3521)

  - A symbolic link issue was found in rpm. It occurs when rpm sets the desired permissions and credentials
    after installing a file. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to exchange the original file with
    a symbolic link to a security-critical file and escalate their privileges on the system. The highest
    threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
    (CVE-2021-35938)

  - It was found that the fix for CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501 was incomplete: the check was only
    implemented for the parent directory of the file to be created. A local unprivileged user who owns another
    ancestor directory could potentially use this flaw to gain root privileges. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. (CVE-2021-35939)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.");
