"The version of FreeBSD installed on the remote host is prior to tested version. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities as referenced in the 1f0421b1-8398-11ed-973d-002b67dfc673 advisory.

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. In affected versions there is an out of
    bound read in ZGFX decoder component of FreeRDP. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to
    read out of bound data and try to decode it likely resulting in a crash. This issue has been addressed in
    the 2.9.0 release. Users are advised to upgrade. (CVE-2022-39316)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing a
    range check for input offset index in ZGFX decoder. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to
    read out of bound data and try to decode it. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0. There are no
    known workarounds for this issue. (CVE-2022-39317)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    input validation in `urbdrc` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to crash with
    division by zero. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0. All users are advised to upgrade. Users
    unable to upgrade should not use the `/usb` redirection switch. (CVE-2022-39318)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    input length validation in the `urbdrc` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to
    read out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and
    all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `/usb` redirection switch.
    (CVE-2022-39319)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP may attempt
    integer addition on too narrow types leads to allocation of a buffer too small holding the data written. A
    malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of bound data and send it back to the
    server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
    to upgrade should not use the `/usb` redirection switch. (CVE-2022-39320)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    path canonicalization and base path check for `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP
    based client to read files outside the shared directory. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0
    and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `/drive`, `/drives` or
    `+home-drive` redirection switch. (CVE-2022-39347)

  - FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing
    input length validation in `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read
    out of bound data and send it back to the server. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all
    users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the drive redirection channel -
    command line options `/drive`, `+drives` or `+home-drive`. (CVE-2022-41877)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
