"The remote Ubuntu 20.04 LTS host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in
the USN-5875-1 advisory.

  - A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Broadcom Full MAC Wi-Fi driver. This issue occurs
    when a user connects to a malicious USB device. This can allow a local user to crash the system or
    escalate their privileges. (CVE-2022-3628)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Linux Kernel. Affected is the function
    l2cap_conn_del of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads
    to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this
    vulnerability is VDB-211944. (CVE-2022-3640)

  - Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC
    interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It
    appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol
    headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not
    the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x)
    though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with
    split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core,
    resulting in said misbehavior. (CVE-2022-3643)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function
    nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after
    free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
    The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992. (CVE-2022-3649)

  - drivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-
    after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race
    condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect. (CVE-2022-41849)

  - roccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition
    and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a
    report->value is in progress. (CVE-2022-41850)

  - There is an infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_parse_conf_req
    function which can be used to leak kernel pointers remotely. We recommend upgrading past commit
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b1a2cd50c0357f243b7435a732b4e62ba3157a2e
    https://www.google.com/url (CVE-2022-42895)

  - There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_connect
    and l2cap_le_connect_req functions which may allow code execution and leaking kernel memory (respectively)
    remotely via Bluetooth. A remote attacker could execute code leaking kernel memory via Bluetooth if within
    proximity of the victim. We recommend upgrading past commit https://www.google.com/url
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/711f8c3fb3db61897080468586b970c87c61d9e4
    https://www.google.com/url (CVE-2022-42896)

  - The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and 6.0.2 are vulnerable to buffer
    overflow. NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send
    buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force the send buffer
    to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message. The RPC
    message with garbage data is still correctly formed according to the specification and is passed forward
    to handlers. Vulnerable code in NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the
    allocated buffer space. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVE-2022-43945)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. l2cap_config_req in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c
    has an integer wraparound via L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets. (CVE-2022-45934)

  - In binder_vma_close of binder.c, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking. This could
    lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is
    not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-254837884References:
