"The remote Ubuntu 18.04 LTS host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in
the USN-5861-1 advisory.

  - An issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and
    incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted
    IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured. (CVE-2022-2663)

  - Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is possible for a guest to trigger a NIC
    interface reset/abort/crash in a Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It
    appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux network stack that packet protocol
    headers are all contained within the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is not
    the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x)
    though it may be an issue with other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests with
    split headers, netback will forward those violating above mentioned assumption to the networking core,
    resulting in said misbehavior. (CVE-2022-3643)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects
    the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The
    manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a
    patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3646)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function
    nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after
    free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
    The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992. (CVE-2022-3649)

  - In v4l2_m2m_querybuf of v4l2-mem2mem.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper input
    validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-223375145References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20369)

  - Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow
    an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. (CVE-2022-26373)

  - Mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions may allow arbitrary speculative code execution
    under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions. (CVE-2022-29900)

  - Intel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that is able to bypass their
    retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker with unprivileged user access can
    hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution under certain
    microarchitecture-dependent conditions. (CVE-2022-29901)

  - ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in
    drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an
    integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to
    copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can
    actually happen. (CVE-2022-39842)

  - drivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-
    after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race
    condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect. (CVE-2022-41849)

  - roccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition
    and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a
    report->value is in progress. (CVE-2022-41850)

  - There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_connect
    and l2cap_le_connect_req functions which may allow code execution and leaking kernel memory (respectively)
    remotely via Bluetooth. A remote attacker could execute code leaking kernel memory via Bluetooth if within
    proximity of the victim. We recommend upgrading past commit https://www.google.com/url
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/711f8c3fb3db61897080468586b970c87c61d9e4
    https://www.google.com/url (CVE-2022-42896)

  - drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-
    space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory. (CVE-2022-43750)

  - The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and 6.0.2 are vulnerable to buffer
    overflow. NFSD tracks the number of pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send
    buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages. A client can force the send buffer
    to shrink by sending an RPC message over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message. The RPC
    message with garbage data is still correctly formed according to the specification and is passed forward
    to handlers. Vulnerable code in NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the
    allocated buffer space. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVE-2022-43945)

  - An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. l2cap_config_req in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c
    has an integer wraparound via L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets. (CVE-2022-45934)
