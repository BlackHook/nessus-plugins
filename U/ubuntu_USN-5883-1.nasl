"The remote Ubuntu 16.04 ESM host has a package installed that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in
the USN-5883-1 advisory.

  - An issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can be confused and
    incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed when users are using unencrypted
    IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured. (CVE-2022-2663)

  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects
    the function kcm_tx_work of the file net/kcm/kcmsock.c of the component kcm. The manipulation leads to
    race condition. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-211018 is the identifier
    assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3521)

  - A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability
    is the function area_cache_get of the file drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the
    component IPsec. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this
    issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3545)

  - A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel Broadcom Full MAC Wi-Fi driver. This issue occurs
    when a user connects to a malicious USB device. This can allow a local user to crash the system or
    escalate their privileges. (CVE-2022-3628)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Linux Kernel. Affected is the function
    l2cap_conn_del of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads
    to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this
    vulnerability is VDB-211944. (CVE-2022-3640)

  - A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Linux Kernel. This issue affects
    the function nilfs_attach_log_writer of the file fs/nilfs2/segment.c of the component BPF. The
    manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack may be initiated remotely. It is recommended to apply a
    patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211961 was assigned to this vulnerability. (CVE-2022-3646)

  - A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function
    nilfs_new_inode of the file fs/nilfs2/inode.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to use after
    free. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.
    The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211992. (CVE-2022-3649)

  - A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SYSCTL subsystem in how a user changes certain
    kernel parameters and variables. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their
    privileges on the system. (CVE-2022-4378)

  - In v4l2_m2m_querybuf of v4l2-mem2mem.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper input
    validation. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User
    interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID:
    A-223375145References: Upstream kernel (CVE-2022-20369)

  - Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow
    an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. (CVE-2022-26373)

  - Mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions may allow arbitrary speculative code execution
    under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions. (CVE-2022-29900)

  - Intel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that is able to bypass their
    retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker with unprivileged user access can
    hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution under certain
    microarchitecture-dependent conditions. (CVE-2022-29901)

  - ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In pxa3xx_gcu_write in
    drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type conflict of size_t versus int, causing an
    integer overflow and bypassing the size check. After that, because it is used as the third argument to
    copy_from_user(), a heap overflow may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can
    actually happen. (CVE-2022-39842)

  - drivers/video/fbdev/smscufx.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition and resultant use-
    after-free if a physically proximate attacker removes a USB device while calling open(), aka a race
    condition between ufx_ops_open and ufx_usb_disconnect. (CVE-2022-41849)

  - roccat_report_event in drivers/hid/hid-roccat.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.12 has a race condition
    and resultant use-after-free in certain situations where a report is received while copying a
    report->value is in progress. (CVE-2022-41850)

  - Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs;
    the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced
    another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the
    XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock
    could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to
    (CVE-2022-42329). (CVE-2022-42328)

  - There is an infoleak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c's l2cap_parse_conf_req
    function which can be used to leak kernel pointers remotely. We recommend upgrading past commit
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b1a2cd50c0357f243b7435a732b4e62ba3157a2e
    https://www.google.com/url (CVE-2022-42895)

  - drivers/usb/mon/mon_bin.c in usbmon in the Linux kernel before 5.19.15 and 6.x before 6.0.1 allows a user-
    space client to corrupt the monitor's internal memory. (CVE-2022-43750)
