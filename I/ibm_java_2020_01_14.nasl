"The version of IBM Java installed on the remote host is prior to 7.0 < 7.0.10.70 / 7.1 < 7.1.4.70 / 8.0 < 8.0.6.15. It
is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the Oracle January 14 2020 CPU advisory.

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Serialization).
    Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u241, 8u231, 11.0.5 and 13.0.1; Java SE Embedded:
    8u231. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple
    protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded.
    Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web
    Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code
    that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be
    exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the
    APIs. (CVE-2020-2583)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Security). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u241, 8u231, 11.0.5 and 13.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u231.
    Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via Kerberos to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This
    vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
    comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be
    exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the
    APIs. (CVE-2020-2590)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Networking).
    Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u241, 8u231, 11.0.5 and 13.0.1; Java SE Embedded:
    8u231. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple
    protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well
    as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This
    vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
    comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be
    exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the
    APIs. (CVE-2020-2593)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Security). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u241, 8u231, 11.0.5 and 13.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u231.
    Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via Kerberos to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. While the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may
    significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data.
    Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web
    Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code
    that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be
    exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the
    APIs. (CVE-2020-2601)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Serialization).
    Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u241, 8u231, 11.0.5 and 13.0.1; Java SE Embedded:
    8u231. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple
    protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
    takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in
    clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load
    and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
    security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through
    a web service which supplies data to the APIs. (CVE-2020-2604)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Supported versions that are
    affected are Java SE: 7u241, 8u231, 11.0.5 and 13.0.1. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows
    unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful
    attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service
    (partial DOS) of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the
    specified Component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as
    through a web service. (CVE-2020-2654)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Networking).
    Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u241 and 8u231; Java SE Embedded: 8u231. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This
    vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
    comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be
    exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the
    APIs. (CVE-2020-2659)
