"The remote host is affected by the vulnerability described in GLSA-202210-02 (OpenSSL: Multiple Vulnerabilities)

  - The Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to
    compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In
    such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent
    over that TLS connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-uses a DH secret across
    multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites.
    This issue affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. OpenSSL
    1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v). (CVE-2020-1968)

  - In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
    EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the
    out parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the outlen parameter is populated with the buffer size
    required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer
    and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the out parameter. A bug
    in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to
    hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size
    required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the
    application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2
    content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to
    a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing
    application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application
    dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).
    (CVE-2021-3711)

  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a
    buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings
    which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not
    a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar
    parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will
    additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for
    applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array
    by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using
    the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to
    assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for
    strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be
    printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the
    application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing
    can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been
    directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the
    certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the
    X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an
    application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL
    functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).
    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive
    plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2y). (CVE-2021-3712)

  - There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are
    affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the
    pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that
    attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
    believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of
    the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of
    resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be
    meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer
    an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was
    addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is
    addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support customers only. It will be made
    available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in
    OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-
    dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb). (CVE-2021-4160)

  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop
    forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain
    elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point
    encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has
    invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a
    denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they
    can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients
    consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking
    certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from
    subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that
    use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS
    issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate
    which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the
    public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-
    signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue
    affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the
    15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc). (CVE-2022-0778)

  - The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This
    script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such
    operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of
    the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.
    Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd). (CVE-2022-1292)

  - The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the
    memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or
    keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand
    without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service.
    Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived
    processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The
    function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue. Fixed in
    OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). (CVE-2022-1473)

  - AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt
    the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was
    preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of in place encryption, sixteen bytes
    of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and
    DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q
    (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p). (CVE-2022-2097)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version
number.");
