"The remote host is affected by the vulnerability described in GLSA-202209-15 (Oracle JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Libraries). Supported
    versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u251, 11.0.7 and 14.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u251. Difficult to
    exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as
    unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: Applies to client
    and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start
    applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the
    specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as
    through a web service. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 4.8 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N). (CVE-2020-14556)

  - Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: ImageIO). Supported versions that are
