"The version of Golang Go installed on the remote host is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, as follows:

  - HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing small inputs,
    potentially leading to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common
    function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold
    the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior to cause an HTTP server to allocate large
    amounts of memory from a small request, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service.
    With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.
    (CVE-2023-24534)

  - Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing
    very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the
    total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed,
    leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased
    pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3.
    ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage
    collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses
    multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service.
    This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http
    package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix,
    ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many
    fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits
    on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit
    may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with
    NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with
    ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with
    the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=. (CVE-2023-24536)

  - Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains //line directives with very large line
    numbers can cause an infinite loop due to integer overflow. (CVE-2023-24537)

  - Templates do not properly consider backticks as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as
    expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template
    action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the
    literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather
    complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template
    actions from being used inside of them (e.g. var a = {{.}}), since there is no obviously safe way to allow
    this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse
    returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is
    currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous
    behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will
    now be escaped. This should be used with caution. (CVE-2023-24538)
